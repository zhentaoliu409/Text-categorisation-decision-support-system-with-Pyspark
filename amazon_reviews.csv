"I bought this on black friday last year and took a chance on it. What chance u say? I read some reviews that this card just actually STOPPED working for no reason and not due to abuse or misuse. I had this card in my Acer Iconia A500 and it just STOPPED WORKING! Even my computer doesnt recognize it. WTF Sandisk?? This is an expensive part for this to occur. DO NOT BUY OR IF U DO, BE CAREFUL WHAT U STORE ON IT! I only had music and movies on mine so NBD. But what if u had this in your phone with valuable pictures?",1
"I bought it for my new galaxy note and I realized the device didn't recognize it...tried it on other devices, laptops, desktop, macbook didn't work...Very disappointed !",1
"Received one - didn't work. Not readable on my Mac or my Win 7 PC. Tried another - retail packaging and is raw format and although my Galaxy S3 sees it, it won't write or format and the computers don't pick it up either.Taking the other person's 1 star review and trying a class 6. Can't afford to lose data, not that I can write to these anyway. Both went back.",1
"after doing some tests between a generic memory card and this sandisk i am very disappointed. i bought the 32 gig class (10) card.i swore i picked ""original packaging"" but it was shipped with out original packaging... i will be returning this card for the following reasons:these tests were done using the sd card ports on my pc.my generic class (6) 32 gig card has upload speed of 22MB (write) and a transfer speed of 8.5.my sandisk i just bought, it has an upload speed peaking at 32MB (write) and a transfer speed of 6.5 to maybe 8.5 if im lucky.the write speed is ok, but why is the transfer speed so much more low. why isnt it at least 10MB if not 12MB if sandisk is typically so modest in their classifications?and whats the deal with the no classification marking on this sd card... i dont see class (10) anywhere on this card....amazon you will be getting this back!",1
Just started unmounting and remounting all by itself.  Really sucked the battery life for a while there. A quick google search showed this to be a common problem.  Oh well...,1
"I inserted this into my Galaxy Note, powered the phone on and went into storage. I pressed on 'mount sd card' it said it didn't understand the filesystem and asked if I wanted to format it. I did and then I saw 59 gigs of free space.Works great and got it for 43 bucks off Amazon.Con:It's extremely slow to write to. If I try to write a 3gb file from my PC to the card it takes about 26 minutes (2MB a sec). If I write to the internal SD card on my phone it writes at 10MB a sec. I don't understand why it's that slow. I can accept that it will be slower than an internal SD however I didn't know it would be dog slow. My 32GB samsung micro sd was much faster...",1
"I hate it, it worked fine for 2 months and the after those 2 months it started with problems, first, every once and a while was not recognized by my device, and now 4 months after, I have to pull it out and then place it again in every hour.....It might have been just my microSd problem.... But I wont purchase one of this ever again",1
"Broke after  2 weeks.....I will go back to Samsung HD cards... This was a waste of time and money. Actually, I should ask for a refund",1
"The 64GB card I purchased actually contains 4GB of flash memory and some kind of hack that causes it to appear as a 64GB drive in various drives and readers. Of course, this took me a while to figure out since I only just got around to copying more than 4GB of data to the card, but with some testing I have nonetheless discovered this to be the case.The card I bought was in Amazon Frustration Free packaging. I don't know if cards purchased that way are less likely to be counterfeit than retail packaged versions, but I suspect that I will stick with manufacturer packaging from now on.",1
"Bought October 7th. Passed away December 23rd. RIP.I didn't really even use it because of the built in storage on my GS3. I had about 15 gb of music and movies on it, but only for when I was unexpectedly bored and without my zuneHd. On to the next brand I guess.",1
Unable to read.It says it's blank.It then prompts to format or cancel.I clicked Format but Unable to Format.,1
"I wish I could say this card was great. Been waiting for it for around a year and a half whilst using the 64GB one (also SanDisk) which never gave me issues; sadly I lost it. This card confused the heck out of me. I used it on my S4 and first off, it wouldn't recognize it. Tried it on my gf's S4 and same problem.Apparently it comes formatted as exFAT and thought maybe reformatting it as FAT32 would solve the problem. Well I thought it did since my phone finally recognized it upon inserting it. A new problem arose, though. I started taking pictures to try it out and odd thing was some of the pictures became corrupted. Not even viewable on the phone seconds after taking them. Some worked, others not.Later on, I restarted my phone for some reason or other. A while later I wanted to check the pictures again and, surprise surprise, everything was gone. I'd find out later that every time I restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted. Tried it on my gf's phone and same thing happened.Tried reformatting again as FAT32 using GParted (couldn't hurt) and it just throws errors upon starting the write sequence.Too bad I can't return it as I had it shipped to me in Guatemala. So that's $119 down the toilet. I have to buy a new one now, but I think I'll go for the new Samsung EVO ones (although they don't offer a 128GB model as of this writing - bummer).",1
"I bought this Sandisk 16GB Class 10 to use with my HTC Inspire, after 3 months, I am getting constant error saying SD Card unmounted unexpectedly.Then today, the dang fkang card won't even read in the card reader, I have 10GB worth of videos and pictures, memories that I will never be able to get back. I am very upset.",1
"I was using mine in a GoPro Hero 3.  The card just broke for no reason.  There is controversy weather its the GoPro or SanDisk, but after doing some Google research it seems that its more of SanDisk's fault as these SD cards also fail (or used to) in varies Samsung devices (phones / tablets).  Amazon sent me a replacement, so no harm done, but for the money you would expect something top notch.GoPro users (on the support forums) recommend getting 2x32GB SD cards, which have not had any issues as far as anyone knows.  The worst part is losing important content, I was lucky, I copied my movies from the SD card onto a HD on my PC.  Others not so lucky.",1
"First, it kept unmounting on the Galaxy Note 10.1I got it replaced.I used the replacement on my Galaxy S4 and it heats up my phone when charging. IT GETS VERY HOT. GS4 does not get hot with other sd cards. awaiting my second replacement.",1
"I am going to start spending a little more money if needed and start buying Transcend. The one Transcend thumb drive I've purchased, 64G, works great and always has. The SanDisk 64G thumb drive always had some kind of annoying problem until it finally quit working. Everything I've been told to do to reformat and reset it doesn't help. And FYI, I ALWAYS ejected the drive before I disconnected it. These memory cards from SanDisk that I've bought also have these little headaches all the time. All my Transcend work great and they have been faster to copy my 40G worth of music to. Spend the little extra money if need be and buy the Transcend.",1
"No way to format it. I even downloaded 2 programs that claimed were able to format it, After wasting about 6 hours, I decided to give up and send it back, The seller should format them before sending them, even if they would charge $5. extra, it would be well worth it instead of the hassle of downloading programs and wasting time trying and sending it back after hours of frustration.",1
"If your card gets hot enough to be painful, it is defective and you need to contact SanDisk!From my experience, the larger micro SDs run hot on format and writing, but not to the pain threshold!I purchased one of these cards to use in a camera and Android tablet.  Great read speed but write speed was okay.  Used card for about two weeks and then all my files disappeared!  Tried to format the card and three different computers with XP, Windows, and Linux couldn't format it.  The camera and tablet couldn't format it.  I RMA'd it and got another because SanDisk is a good brand.  I did notice that when formatting or writing the card it got hot, very hot.Second card didn't last 24 hours and had the exact same symptoms as the first card.  Write a file or format it resulted in the card getting hot enough to reach the pain threshold.  I called up SanDisk and while explaining this was the second card I'd received with the exact same symptoms, when I mentioned it getting hot, they immediately issued me an RMA.  They said they were told to issue an RMA the moment they heard a card ran hot.Smaller SanDisk micro SD's or regular SD's I have or use don't do this.  I think SanDisk has an issue with this card.The last 4 digits of the part number refer to the date code and origin of the card.  Both cards had different date and origin codes.",1
"There's a lot of counterfeits on these, and I apparently picked up a bum card from MemoryWhiz. My device shows me there's a 32gb of space there; it just is impossible to gain access to it. Rather, the /sdcard folder is found on my device's internal memory (the memory that came with the device). I even downloaded some apps that were supposed to read and write from my SDCard, but they work even when I unmount the card and remove it. So check out these cards thoroughly when you buy them and make sure they're what they say they are. Naturally, SanDisk isn't going to stand by a counterfeit.",1
"This review is for the SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A) that was purchased for me from Amazon.FRUSTRATING in a word. This card was reported by two different Android phones as damaged but my Windows computer recognized it with no issues. If the card had nothing on it or had just been reformatted then the phones recognized it but as soon as data, music or pictures were added then the phones reported the card as damaged. I had this card returned to Amazon after 3 days of sheer frustration.I read another review that suggested the Class 10 cards were not ideal for smart phones. I was already using a Sandisk Class 4 16GB card in another phone and had never had issues so I purchased a Class 4 Sandisk 32GB and it was as smooth as butter. Both phones recognized the card right away and added data, music and pictures seamlessly and quickly. The second card purchased was the SanDisk microSDHC 32GB Flash Memory Card, Black, SDSDQM-032G-B35 (Retail Packaging).In summary this card may work just fine for other devices but based on the sheer number of other reviewers (here on Amazon and elsewhere on the internet) that had similar issues with smartphones I cannot recommend this card for a smartphone.",1
"I purhased this thinking I was getting an amazing deal.  The price was right, the product was not.  After a few months I am unable to delete or add files, pics or music to this microsd card.  I am only using 28gb of space on it.  I cannot add anything, nor delete anything, it won't even allow me to format it and start fresh.  I am not happy with this product and extremely disappointed.  I use my phone a lot and store music and pictures on my phone for various purposes.  I would recommend buying another 64gb microsd card.  One that is more reliable.",1
"Card has failed several times in the phone I installed it in. I purchased it for the phone where it has resided for a month. In that time, it has required reformatting three times which makes its utility useless as a storage device.",1
"Could not figure out why this card crashed multiple times in my Samsung Galaxy SIII, and demanded a reformatting. Then after 5hrs of calls to Sprint & Samsung I got a guy who reads factory stuff!Samsung Galaxy SIII is a Class 4 & Class 6 supported Motherboard, with Qualcomm processor. The Sprint stores only sell Class 4 memory, and there is a reason that Camera memory~Class 10 is not sold there, the board, just like in a PC, has to support the data stream. It does not!If you have an Android Phone you better make sure the motherboard supports it! Even Samsung's USA website does not tell you the board supported memory! They won't, and don't tell who the board manufacturer is in this Galaxy SIII phone. I asked at the Texas Samsung advanced tech support center after 1hr on hold, and they had no specs to even share. They don't get it!PASS IF YOU HAVE A CELL PHONE, UNLESS YOU GET IT IN WRITING FROM THE MOTHERBOARD MANUFACTURER OF YOUR PHONE. I went through this same stuff building custom PC's with Intel motherboards. Memory has to be built to run on this board, at this speed, with this processor, or it will not work properly, and will crash, and lose data.",1
"Was working fine for 2 months. Randomly stopped working. Is not recognized by my computer or cell phone. I am beyond the Amazon return window, so this absolutely sucks.Wasted my money.",1
"I got this product exactly 1 month and 3 days ago. Prior to today, it was working fine. Out of nowhere, my Micro SD card can't be read anymore. I've tried several phones, and 3 different laptops (both OSX and Windows 7), and it doesn't even show up anymore. Be weary of the product. You may end up with a lemon.",1
"Yeah. Ultra Hot. I could not get any of my devices to recognize this card. When I finally was, using a USD reader, I tried to format it. It wouldn't format and burned my fingers when I removed it. Others have also posted this. Maybe they are not all bad, but many are. Perhaps they are counterfeit, I don't know. But the hassle of having to return it isn't worth the $10 you may save.",1
"With all the great reviews on this card, I picked this up for my Samsung Galaxy S III. Popped in the card, and I was happy taking pictures, saving files, and living life.Fast forward two months later, and all of a sudden, the card stops functioning. My phone won't read it any more. My computer won't read it either. Submitted a ticket to Sandisk. Hopefully I can get a replacement that actually works.Thank goodness I saved all my photos on Dropbox.",1
Failed after a year!,1
Used for two months in Samsung Galaxy.  Fizzled then failed.  I have never experienced a memory card or or flash drive failure until this SanDisk Ultra 32 GB.  Will purchase a different brand next time.  Return for refund or replacement is not allowed.,1
"Thank God for amazon return policy or I would be incensed.  This little platic device from hell died unexpectedly after 37 days.  I lost all my phone pictures that were not stored on the phone.  I lost the music but have most on PC.  I lost the videos I had from concerts.What happened was the phone gave me a warning that the storage device (Sandisk Ultra) could not be found.  I took it out and restarted my Galaxy Note 2 and it worked.  then about one hour later I got the same warning.  I tried to save my data with MY Backup Pro App (I had to purchase an extra 3 GBs of data for cloud because the App comes with only 75 MB or something like that and so I backed up everything on the Sandisk Storage).  And as it was backing everything on line  using the Backup Pro Cloud, the Sandisk fried and stopped the backup process.  I was prompted to format the storage disc but everytime I performed this process, the phone would not complete the format.  Now keep in mind that I was not near a computer because I was on vacation so I could not use a computer to format in Fat32.I am returning this disc and purchasing a Samsung 32 GB that costs over 50 bucks.  You get what you pay for.",1
"Everything transfered over to my new SD card fine, but now my phone will randomly lose the SD card and have to search and re-scan it. Tried another SD card and no problems. Now I can only get a refund since its out of stock.Updated 12/9/12-SD card will not not work. My phone or computer will not read it. Lost everything. I'd advise if you are looking to purchase an SD card look at another brand.",1
"As the title says, the card I got is defective and faulty. The issue is, the sd card always unmounts and then remounts and sometimes it will says the the sd card is corrupted and needs to be formatted, so first I tried to format it using my cellphone (xperia play) copied all my files again to the sd card and it gave me the same error tried 2 other phones (inspire 3g and Samsung Galaxy S4) still same error, then I tried to take it out and put it in my computer and manually format AND check for bad sectors and fix errors and it will not finish and says &#34;cannot continue because sd card is corrupted&#34;.  I searched google and find out the Sandisk have shipped a bad Batch of Sd cards, so i contacted the company and demanded for a return because its past due to return it through amazon, got RMA'ed and already shipped it and I do not know how long will it take to for them to send me another sd card. So now I do now have any sd card to put my files because of this situations that could've avoided if Sandisk's QA Department is not slacking off. Very disappointed customer.",1
"the unit shows 0 bytes, in a PC or the phone. it keeps dismounting also. I got a replacement and it did the same thing. Not sure what is going on but it looks like a Chinese counterfeit case. I have seen this happen more and more lately. Amazon seems to be a major portal for these hings, it makes sense with a such a large retailer, they cant check everything.",1
06.NOV.2012 - Bought the card.12.JAN.2014 - Card failed.It cannot be formatted or used in any way.It lasted 14 months and most of that time I was not even using it.,1
"I've only had this Memory card for 3.5 weeks and it not only has recently started resetting, it intermittently loses contact with my Cell phone and the memory is lost, erasing everything on it!!!!!! Now I find out my return date has past and I'm stuck with a peice of s*** memory card that I can't do a damn thing about! Thanks a lot for nothing! I will never buy direct from here again!Also, I didn't realize I was supposed to have an adapter too? wow where the heck is that at???",1
"Bought this for Galaxy S3, worked like a charm for 3 months & then I started getting error messages on phone stating the card has been taken out or that it is not there, went on like this for a week or so & then one day gone. Initially I thought it was problem with phone. Popped in a 2Gb card from BB & it worked. Popped this one into the BB & same, no detection. After spending so much on an SD card its disappointing to see it go bust outside of return period.",1
"I am hoping that I received a defective product and that my experience is rare, but this product did not work as intended. I was replacing another 32G micro sd card thinking that, because this is a Class 10 rated product, it would be faster. It never worked correctly. It kept dismounting unexpectedly, losing data, and was just not worth the money AT ALL! I ended up using my slower rated product which has worked reliably since the day I bought it. I only wish this product had done the same.",1
Sandisk has the name but in my experience the quality and speed is not there. My lexar lasted longer and outperformed this chip.,1
"I thought this was a sure winner from the average 4.5+ rating with thousands of reviews.  But if you notice the bad reviews involve the card becoming unreliable after a couple weeks of use. Typically people write reviews shortly after receiving the product.  My card worked fine for 2 weeks and then started having problems.  I re-formatted the card, re-inserted in the phone, removed the battery, every trick I could read about but the card still remained unreliable and the phone was thinking it was being removed at random times.  So I stuck my olders, slower 8GB microSD card in, worked fine.I suspect one or both is happening with this card:(a) Some cards are defective but it takes some usage for them to start failing to where the user notices.(b) For some reason, this brand of card doesn't like certain devices, like my Samsung Galaxy S3My guess is I got a lemon, but I'm not chancing it to getting another one and will just move on to another reputable brand.""You get what you pay for"" may be applicable here.  But a lot of others did have success with this card.  So YMMV.",1
The only reason I give one star is that I cant give zero stars.Just lost all my files in the SD in my S3. I cant believe I trust my valuable information in this company. AVOID THIS ITEM. Dont recommend it.,1
"As others have found, these cards do not last. Mine died in less than 2 months. Lost several photos that I had not backed up yet. The warranty replacement died within 3 months.Go with another brand. I've been using a Kingston and so far, 9 months later, still working.",1
"This card no longer is readable by three different phones after only six months of very light usage (very few pictures had been saved to the card), where it was never taken in or out of the phone before it showed signs of dying (thus the death was not caused by excessive handling of the card).",1
"I love SanDisk, and I have used quite a few of their products, including an mp3 player, a couple of USB keys and even a micro SD card (class 4). I have never had any problems. After installing this card, however, I have seen it unmounting itself randomly to be detected again and automatically being mounted by my Galaxy S4 device. This happens several times a day, including when I am in the middle of watching a movie on the phone (this is the first week that I have had the card). This is unacceptable. Normally, I would have just asked for a replacement, but after doing some research online, I have found out that this seems to be a recurrent problem on many phone models and doesn't seem to be just ""a dud"", but a production issue. I have returned the card, and I am going to go with another brand instead.",1
"I installed this on my Galaxy Note 2 and it crashed after one month. Lost all my pictures on the card. Had it not been for Google Plus instant upload and redundant backup to Dropbox all of the pictures would have been lost. I think I should get a refund but I did not keep the original packaging. I would not buy this, but if you do keep the packaging so you can return it. If you read most of the reviews you will see that a lot of people have had trouble with this card crashing. I don't think Amazon should offer it as it hurts their overall customer satisfaction.",1
"I have zero complaints, this card does exactly what it should. I'm amazed by how inexpensive memory cards continue to get. These things are really useful to throw on your keychain because they're so small.Update: From 5 stars to 1. Dead after 4 months. Appears to be a fairly common issue: [...] Let's see how the RMA process goes....",1
"I bought two of these from a major electronics retailer to make sure I don't get a bootleg one and they both crapped out on me. I usually buy from amazon but I needed them rig away . So unless that company has bought a large batch of bootleg cards or maybe I'm retarded. I bought them from the same store but different locations. I have switched brands now. Not taking anymore chances just in case a flood of bootleg ones hit the retail chains too. It worked fine at first but as the card filled up both times, both times they died and my pc or phone couldn't reformat it or recognize it. Good luck if you buy this major name brand, I thought they were the best too but not for me I guess.",1
"This card does not work on droid razr phones. Whenever I try to transfer files on the card, it makes the phone freeze completely. I have tried every possibility to get this to work, but this type of card is worthless because it does not work due to its high capacity on phones. Every workaround I have tried to get this card to work, it still causes my phone to freeze.",1
"Pros: Looks good, works fine until it starts acting up.Cons : Worked for 6-8 months in 2 Samsung S3 phones, and 3 months in a Samsung Galaxy Note 8. One by one they all died, became unreadable. Cannot format either. Just dead. Wasted.Sandisk did not post any disclaimers like don't bother to use this in a Samsung device.",1
"Although Amazon claim it is a C10 ultra fast Memory Card, it actually has much slower write speed than other C10 microSD card (it only scores about 60% of the normal speed). For example, I have tested it against my old Maxell C10 HC microSD card. The test was done by writing the same 3035MB random data from DRAM to empty microSD card through a USB3 card reader. The resulting time was the average value from 3 tests of each device:SanDisk Ultra 32GB C10/UHS1: 5m50.816s means 8.7MB/sMaxell C10 HC: 3m38.787s means 13.9MB/sThe speed is completely unacceptable for a Class-10 claim (13% lower than 10MB/s, the lowest boundary of Class-10 device), even the over-advertisement of SD card speeds are common (claiming 30MB/s for actual 12-15MB/s). It is almost a scam. Some Class-6 card will beat this ""Class-10"" card.",1
Tried this with its adapter on DSLR Camera and got some errors at times while trying to save data to card.  It is ok for other uses like computer external data.,2
This might be my 3rd 32 GB disk that I buy from scanDisk.They work for few months and then NOTHING...My tablet wont detect them anymore... my computer wouldn't either.Quite disappointing.,2
"I bought 4 of these units (yes, at Amazon):  SanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-032G-U46A for 3 Samsung Galaxy SIII and one Samsung Note 2, and found that one in the SGIII has stopped working. I tried everything, in a computer, in different adapters - dead is dead. Since the other three are used by non-techno people, I am not sure if they are still working or not.When I contacted SanDisk, they gave me test instructions, which of course all failed the tests. To return, I have to pay for shipping that MUST BE tracked. This will cost around $20 for a $26 item. I ignored this, and shipped with a regular mail. I should not expect anything back, but who knows.For $6 more I have another unit, and I can tell you it will not be a SanDisk Ultra. Oh, well, the average price for the 3 remaining units will then be $34 (33% more than the purchase price).If I get a replacement, I will update this message.Update:I got an e-mail from SanDisk to advise me that they did receive the item and it is being processed. Shipping without tracking cost me $0.65 vs. $20. At least I have to give their customer service (or return department?) credit for being honest. Too bad the memory cards have problems, as SanDisk had an excellent name for providing good quality products. Maybe I should give this another 1/2 star, but there no such thing.",2
"I noticed a long time ago that even when not really running at very fast speeds (and I'm mostly talking about reading as mostly it was playing music and video files) this card seems to get fairly warm.  After a while -- pretty much just outside the point at which I could RMA it -- it started randomly disconnecting.  At first I thought it was my phone though I had no clue why it would ever do such a thing, so I wouldn't have sent it in at that point anyway.  It always seemed to be fine when I plugged it into my computer.  Over time it got worse and worse and I would have to remove and put it back in quite a few times to get it to finally work.  Eventually it started doing this on the computer too and that's when I realized something was fishy.  I switched to another card in my phone and the problems went away.  On the other hand, this one stopped working completely a bit later even in the computer.Maybe I just got a bad one, but right now I'd rather get a different one instead if I were to buy a new one.",2
First of all Amazon has shipped the mobile version of this card. It is different that what was listed on the page. There goes a star for incorrect shipping. And the item has stopped working after a week in my Surface tablet.,2
"After I inserted the micro SD card to the adapter I can no longer removed it from the adapter. It was stuck inside the adapter permanently. I definitely received a defective item. I also read a lot of reviews saying this card have bad sectors.Another, while I was transferring from my computer the transferring of files suddenly stopped and said there was an error.Sandisk's quality control department should up their game. They're selling products to the general public that are defective and flawed (not all of them BUT a lot of them). It's just not me. I also read a lot of reviews saying the card they got were also defective.",2
"I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn't work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.

"I was very excited to buy this card (64 gb) for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - The product arrived promptly and I was able to format it to EX Fat and use it right away in my smart phone. However, exactly 10 days later when I removed the card (after turning off the phone) and inserted it in my Desktop, I got an error saying that the card was corrupted and unreadable and that I needed to format it.Since I had already got a lot of data on it, including a lot of videos and images of our new-born twins, formatting was not a viable option.I tried to get the card working on my PC Desktop, Mac Air laptop and the Samsung Galaxy Note, but to no avail.  Finally I decided to format it. There too, I kept getting errors and that the computer was unable to format the card.  Finally I tried ""Full Format"" via my pc - got an error again and then right away ""Quick Format"" and that worked - so the card is back and working in my Note again, but now I wont trust it anymore - not after having lost so many irreplaceable images and videos.I am a professional photographer, and use memory cards all the time - this has been the worst of the lot !!",2
"I think I got 8 or 9 months out of this before it started to fail. It is still working intermittently but my phone will suddenly stop being able to read it for no apparent reason. &#34;Designed for durability&#34; my foot. It might survive in salt water but it didn't survive in a phone that, frankly, doesn't get a whole lot of use. This is the first Sandisk product I've ever had fail on me. It may still be under warranty but I don't care. Now that I have to replace it I'm going to go with another brand.",2
"For the first two months, the card worked great in my GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition.  Then, one night, it randomly stopped working.  Amazon won't take it back, and I've got an email into SanDisk to see if I can get it replaced.  Now I'm out $52 and now can't use my camera.  Thanks so little.",2
So this product is a large disappointment...bought it to use in my tablet but the card is forever getting corrupted....I've reformatted the card a few times but it's to the point now that even a reformat doesn't work..  Wasted money...don't recommend purchasing.,2
Stopped working and could not reformat.  Didn't have good luck with this item or the vendor selling this item.  Hopefully just a bad one...sandisk is usually pretty good,2
SanDisk told me I needed to send this to them to format it. It will not recognize in any of my items.,2
"8 gb card works fine in the device, but this 32 gb card will unmount when moving or copying large amounts of data.Never tried reformatting or in-depth troubleshooting, but I expect products from a reputable company like SanDisk to just work.",2
I am now awaiting a replacement from Sandisk because it failed after the Amazon return period.  Always had good luck with Sandisk cards until now.  Phone and PC simply stopped seeing the card.  Lost all of my data (which i fortunately had backed up elsewhere).,2
"I used it for something like 10 months in my Galaxy S III (GT-I9305) with original firmware, mainly for pictures and flac files.Suddenly I perceived that the last pictures I took disappeared; I took some more pictures as I thought that were software problems but same problem until I realized that the card was not working. Now I can't write it anymore or delete information, format it, delete partition, etc. Now is a ROM. The bright side is that I did not lose valuable information like pictures that now are permanently stored in the card.",2
I have two of these and use them for my Galazy Note 2. It's great having the flexibility to keep extra storage with you for your 'phablet'.So far they have done what they are intended to do.,3
"I will keep it short and sweet for potential buyers looking for facts and not b.s.I own two of the 32gb size of these cards for about 3 months now. They do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets, yet not so good with cameras, in fact these cards failed to work with my GoPro Hero3 camera and the customer service rep from Gopro claimed (and I happen to agree with him) that this card is not a true class 10 card let alone UHS-1.Benchmarks with my evo 4g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond 8mb/s while read speeds wondered around 25mb/s far below advertised speeds, well write speeds arent technically advertised (probably because they are of class 4 level)Benchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower (due to adapter) with write speeds around 6mb/s while read speeds wondered around 20mb/s.Needless to say, if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage, these are perfect. If you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however, I suggest you not to loose your money on this, because even if your write speeds are around 10mb/s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless.Again this review is based on GoPro camera and high definition raw recording.. For cell phones or for storage it works perfectly well with a bit of false advertisement..",3
"The chip worked fine, fit perfectly, but it is SO TINY, if it falls out you are going to have a hard time finding it.If your application is a Tablet, or pad, if it has a &#34;push-in&#34; holder...you will want to put some tape, or other securing agent across the top of the chip and onto the Table sides.  If I had thought of it, clear finger nail polish would have worked just fine, or even a half drop of super glue on the top.I didn't, and it's forever gone now.  I changed from Android to Ipad and very satisfied that I upgraded to Apple.",3
It's the wrong one because I thought I was getting the 64 GB one.  I need to know  how to return this one and I will reorder the right one.,3
Worked for awhile and then android would blow chunks (unexpectedly removed).  Windows sometimes could not read them and just blew up explorer.  Formated FAT32 .... ect ect ect over and over.  I'm done with SanDisk.  I think the problem is the CLASS 10 part of these cards.  All other cards I have work fine and they are less than class 10.  Maybe this was a bad batch because my replacement card a few days later (from Amazon) did the same thing again.EDIT: Decided to pick up the card that was laying on my counter for the last 3 months and give things another try.  Still does not work in HTC Evo LTE or EVO 3D.  Finally got it working in Galaxy S3.  Still very frustrating.,3
"I use it for my galaxy s4 and this card crashed on me few times, i lost all my photos and music. Thankfully they were all backed up but the worst part is, the card completely stopped working at one point. I had to contact sandisk for a replacement and it was a hassle.",3
"I've had the item 12 months. I've always had minor problems. It just recently started freezing and rebooting my devices. 2 GS3's, currently S4. SanDisk is sending me a new one.",3
"I put this in my Samsung Skyrocket phone.  Even though the phone says 32 GB  max, it still recognized and formatted the card.  Its great to have all of that space.However, any time i try to use the USB mass storage mode to transfer files, it errors out.  I thought it was the phone since it was larger than the max spec, but then I tried it in a USB card reader I had.  It still errored out trying the same files.  Finally, I had to put it in the adapter, and stick it in a card reader built into a laptop and transfer the files that way.I think the issue was that using the USB 2.0 the files were writing too fast and faulting out and with the laptop, transferring the files from the wireless network and then to the card, the transfer speed was slow enough that it was successful.  Took all night to get my stuff on the card though.I use it mostly for pics and video on my phone also, works great.  The phone seems to have no trouble accessing anything on the card and it seems  plenty fast for it even when recording high def video which i do a lot of for work.",3
"Like many here, mine failed and I lost my data (but being smart, I had a backup).  After further investigation, I found this product is NOT compatible with Android and a number of devices (cameras, phones, gps unit).  Windows seems to love it though.  Wish I had a windows device that could use 32G... my only one uses a whopping 100k at best.  What a Waste.UPDATE: Reformated is as FAT32 and works ok in my android devices and my Sony camera for about 3 months now.  Still, I keep a hot quick backup (OTA) every day to my desktop computer... I'll just say I'm not 100% confident in it yet.",3
Does it's job and fairly cheap for what it's worth. I had to return my first one and exchange it for another because the first one was defective. Sandisk really needs to do better quality assurance on their products. The second one works perfectly fine. I use it for my GoPro camera.,3
"im currently using it for my nokia lumia 810 and my camera, works very well and very fast! but expensiveEdit: I was really happy with the card until I had to record video on it. It seems that it doesnt write fast and my recordings end up being choppy and unwatchable. I was really disappointed in it, cuz I had to switch back to my phone's storage when recording video.",3
I bought this card for my Samsung Galaxy S3.  Unfortunately it failed after 4 months.  I contacted SanDisk and they promptly sent me another.  It has been going strong for 6 months.,3
"It works fine with my galaxy note 8.0... it is hard to review now for performance, but the price is good... I think.",3
"This product works as described.  It's just not super quick.  I would recommend this product, especially, if you get it on sale.",3
"Does what it says. Hasn't broken yet, and I hope it doesn't break. I've had luck with this brand before. Usually get bored with the product before it breaks.",3
I get the occasional dropped frames when using it to record HD video in HD camera. Solid for the 1 couple of weeks. Time will tell.,3
I have not had any problems with this product and it works as it is supposed to so I would buy again.,3
not sure if it's the card or computer but it only shows up as 32 gig. i tried reformating it and everything and it still says 32gigs.,3
"First two order of this item were fails. They both failed around six months of use. However, Sandisk honored their warranty and completely replaced the items. Still using it, and pretty happy.",3
title pretty much covers it.bought it for my GoPro - with free 2 day delivery (with membership) and the price it was a no-brainer,3
"I bought this primarily to use in my Surface Pro. It would randomly dismount itself. I do not know if it was the Surface's fault or the card's fault. Upon doing a little internet searching, I found this to be a common problem with Sandisk cards and the Surface Pro. I used another brand microSDXC and it has worked fine.",3
"This is a great card. The FPS with this card were incredible. I ended up needing more memory, so I bought the SanDisk 64 GB card.",3
And you wouldn't believe what Sandisk put me through to get a warranty replacement.  However I finally got the replacement and it has been working fine ever since.,3
"Not bad, I doesnt feel any quicker than a normal 32GB card.  And you only get 27GB of storage. 20",3
I got a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 2 and I got this to increase memory. I had hoped to transfer files from my MacBook but it will not recognize the memory card. I need to go to the Apple Genius bar to see if they can figure it out.,3
It works just like it should. It really does work like it should. I bought this thinking it would work and it does!,3
Received a defective one that did not want to format.  Returned it.  Bought a different brand instead although from past experience Sandisk has been fine.,3
"UPDATE 6/18/14: Well, I suppose nothing lasts forever. After almost a year, the card has gone bad. I use the card a lot in my smartphone - a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3 (SGH-T999). All my photos, voice recordings, and downloads go on this card, and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via USB cable. A few days ago, a video file I transferred to my computer refused to play correctly. No video, and the audio was skipping and squealing, which I recognize as the sound of a corrupted file. I thought maybe the transfer didn't complete; tried it again, same result. I tried to play the file right on the phone, and it didn't play on my phone! I knew there was a problem. I tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there, still no luck. Then I deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone, not the SD card - EUREKA. It played perfectly.I formatted the SDXC card twice - once from the phone and once through Windows - and tried the same test. Downloaded video file to the card, then to the phone. Same result both times - it wouldn't play on the SD card, but it did on the phone. All videos used to play perfectly on the SD card. Finally, I swapped out the card for my older, Sandisk Ultra 32GB Micro SDXC card. Like magic, it worked perfectly no matter what I played on it. So yeah, the 64GB card is dead. I should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days ago.Thankfully, Sandisk Ultra products like this carry an incredible Lifetime warranty - or 10 years for regions that don't recognize ""lifetime""; their Extreme line of cards raise that to 30 years! I've contacted their support for an RMA so I'll update this review as events unfold. If they replace it quickly, I'll bump this back up to 5 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. Sandisk Ultra Micro SD cards have never failed me, and this one's no exception. I used to have a 32gb card. They're fast and reliable and never corrupt data, which is more than can be said for some cheaper brands like PNY (those fail quite often). I can't wait to get the new 128GB model!",3
This is my first foray into the microSD card world. I bought this for my GoPro Hero3 white.Pros:- comes with an adapter for easy downloading.- simple to format right out of the box.- reads/writes just fine with no errors.Cons:- the adapter has no spring return like the devices you instert the card into - removing the card from the adapter can be a pain.Overall it's great and does what I need it to do.Hope that helps...,4
Works fine with photo shooting and video recording in EOS camera with the SD adapter. Perfect for tablet and phone memory.,4
I have bought it for around 6 months. It works good so far & both read / write speed meet the described specification.,4
"more like 8mb/s in my Note 10.1 and that's using SanDisk's own app. A bit faster in my Note II, but still a disappointment for devices with quad core processors. Not sure if it's the card or the device, so benefit of the doubt and four stars.",4
The memory is fine but the adapter that it came with was useless.  I did not contact the seller about it since I had another to use.,4
"I had the card about 3 months in my Galaxy S 4 and then it suddenly went into a read only mode. All the data was still there and I was able to copy it all from the card but could not write or format the card. I searched the internet high and low for a solution and then finally contacted Sandisk support. After explaining my problem, they said it will need to be replaced and it would be covered under warranty. The replacement process took about two weeks, they paid for return shipping. I now have the 2nd card and have had it running for about 2 weeks now.We'll see if I just happened to get a bad one or if they all are of questionable quality.",4
"I bought these in hopes to replace my standard Sandisk 64gb models for quickness.  I'm not saying they are lightning fast, but they are definitely faster than the standard version.  I bought one for each of my phones and my tablets,  They work great.  When the 128gb is available, I will try the faster version of those also.",4
"It's been a month now with this SDCard in my phone.  I transfer an average of 3GB of data to and from the device per week.  The SDCard is holding just fine.  Where most tend to crap out or cause problems, this has yet to do it.",4
"I got this because I just couldn't pass up the deal, $17.99. It has been incredibly fast in my HTC Sensation 4g. Pictures are taken and saved instantaneously. Only had it a few days, but have been very happy. Shipping was fast and the packaging was easy to open which is always great in my book. Only issue I had was I had to format it on my computer first before my phone was able to recognize it.",4
I am using this in my Samsung galaxy smart phone and I did not find any issue. easy to access,4
"When I placed this in my Galaxy S4 phone it read it right away at 29.7 GB. Which is expected to loose a few GB. I transferred file from my old card and it was done fast. Although I didn't have large files to start with. I had been looking for a large card and this one fits the bill. The other reviews helped sway my choice. I would recommend this card, so far no issues.",4
"Bought 2 for me and my wife Samsung Galaxy S2 phones.  Took photos and video and there is no issues at all.  Based on my previous experience on similar products I got for DSLR and other cameras,  this thing should last as long as or longer than all my electronics.",4
"Well not much to say...its a good mmc and its fast enough and that's about all you can ask for, using for more storage on my tablet.Update: stopped working after a while, computer said the mmc had an error and after an hour I could not fix, it became locked and would not unlock with any sd adapters I used and because its locked it would not format or erase and wouldn't even read because of the error. It stopped working after amazons very short return policy so I was out of luck with them, luckily SanDisk has a very long (10-lifetime) for its ultra brands, even though it was a hassle and all through email only I got a replacement and that's why I only took one star off",4
This is big and fast for me. I prefer having this side so I wont run out of space and the speed of 32+/- is all I need anyways.  Highly recommend it.,4
"I've gotten four of these for both of my Nikon D7000's and have had little bit of an issue with the adapter cards being out of spec and sticking in the Nikon Camera SD Slots, and one of my card readers. Sure enough, i sanded one down carefully and it fit perfectly.Performance wise, these things scream over regular Class 10 or Class 6 cards and perform nearly excellent. I cant complain other than I wish they were faster, but I'm not getting that for a while at $23 per card.",4
"The price is goodthe looking is nicethe speed is goodit came with an adaptershipping speed is excellentI used it with my Surface Pro & Samsung Galaxy S III, working good on bothThis is a good choice to have :)",4
"It's a nice product, worked perfectly with Windows 7. However, it doesn't quite work when placed inside my AT&T Samsung Galaxy S3. Files copied into it are NOT shown in the S3's file browser. Googled a bit for this problem, and I concluded it's my phone's problem.",4
this product has worked well with my go pro 3 black edition not slow or glitchy love the products and do reccomend,4
"I have a GoPro 3 camera with which the cards (64Gb and 32Gb editions) work perfect.Formatting went perfect, movie recording and picture taking without any problem for the last 6 months now.However, I tried to use it in a Contour+ and the Contour GPS and both cameras are unable to use the cards, I presume these cards do not fit the Contour specifications (unable to format, no way to record on the card).So make sure the card is compatible for its intended use.",4
"Not a bad product at all. I got it for my blackberry Z-10. I had to format it through the phone's software, but afterwards it worked like a charm. A couple months on and no problems. Class 10 and 64 gig, so I have no complaints. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it isn't particularly outstanding in any way, but it is a pretty simple product. Does the job, no problems, good to go.",4
Its amazing the amount of storage we are putting in micro chips these days.  I use this for my dive camera taking videos and pictures.  The chip hasn't let me down yet and no errors.,4
Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  It works well with my camera using its standard size adapter and then is readable by my Note 8.  Seems quick enough for my Canon G12.  I would recommend this.,4
"At the time of writing this review I bought three of these memory cards in last couple of weeks, for work related phones. They work fine in the Samsung Galaxy S3 mini phones. We are happy with the read and write speeds. One small note of caution the price that can be paid for these can vary, so please check around and save a few extra dollars. When installed you will not get the full 32Gb from the SD card - but that is to be expected, so please bear this mind.",4
"Replaced a smaller and slower micro SD card in my phone. I've had other brands corrupt and die in the past. I've grown to only trust SanDisk.It is faster than most other micro-SD cards, the price was right at $27.",4
"I bought this for my Android device and it works great!It even comes with a converter so if I'd like to use it for images or movies I could!I'd highly recommend this product to anyone needing memory for their Phone, Android Player, Camera or anything that uses SD and /or Micro SD!",4
I would recommend this memory card to anyone. It works well with my tablet. I have no problems with it.,4
This rating is based on multiple years of use of this memory card. Its reliable and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a memory card for long term use.,4
This is a very fast and reliable microSD card.  I used this on my Galaxy Note 2 and loaded movies and family pictures.  Transfer time is speedy!,4
If your not sure what card to use in your GoPro this one works fantastic. The majority of stuff Ive seen researching it points to these. With the exception of some issues with the 64GB. But I cant validate that and Im not sure its still a problem. Ive been using these for about 3 years now with no problems.,4
very useful for surface pro to increase capacity from 128GB. Can also be used as backup in case something goes wrong,4
Great value for the price.  Comes with an adaptor so it can be used in multiple types of devices.  I have had no issues with it and would recommend it.,4
"This Micro SD card is perfect for any smartphone user looking to expand the storage on their device. I personally am using one in my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Works like a charm. It is adequately fast, cheap, and fairly reliable. If you are looking for extremely fast speeds however, you should consider the SanDisk Extreme series which are the fastest MicroSD cards in the world. My card came with an adapter that this card plugs into and it becomes a full sized SD card. If you are looking to use this in a camera or any other device that uses SD cards, please look elsewhere. These cards are not nearly as fast as the full sized SD cards used in cameras. The adapter should only be used for transporting data from the phone or other device, to a computer. All in all, these are a great buy for any smartphone user looking for a higher storage capacity. The price fluctuates often, so catch em while there cheep! I got mine for around $30.",4
"I bought this to put in my Olympus PEN E-PM1 camera which takes a standard SD card. Therefore it must go into the adapter to be put into the camera.  Unfortunately there is something touchy about this. Sometimes I turn the camera on and get a card error. Sometimes I can pop the card out and back in and it'll work. This past weekend I couldn't get it to work at all.  I'm guessing it's the camera. Or maybe the adapter?  When I plugged the card and adapter into my computer to copy the pictures off, it worked perfectly. So I'm not sure what the problem is. I make sure to always carry a spare ""normal"" SD card with my camera in case this one stops working.",4
Never had any issues with sandisk adapter card or devices. They work great and this one is no exception. Very small media for my big fingers but I manage. to do what I need to with it and it works well. Last thing is that Amazon's prices are hard to beat!,4
"Stick this in the slot and forget about it.  Not sure what is being stored on this little thing or when I should remove it from my phone but, hey, it's in there.",4
i used it on my sony as15. been using it for almost a month now and i have yet to encounter any problem,4
"The first one I received kept unmounting from my Samsung Galaxy S4.  It was a new phone so I wasn't sure if the problem was the memory card or the phone, but I sent the card back for a replacement and the second one has worked fine.  Just under 6000 songs loaded uses just over half the space.  Love that!",4
"It fit, and it appears to workI have not yet had ANY issues with this cardhowever, I have only been using it for a few weeks...so my comment is based on my experience thus farIf my position changes, I will delete this postso, if you are reading this, then no problems has occurred thus far",4
"What can I say? It's memory, the price was right and it's fast. My galaxy note 10.1 doesn't complain. Neither do I.",4
this works great on my Galaxy S4 right out of the box.and its faster then the old 32gb card i used to have.,4
"SanDisk Ultra Class 10 micro SDHC card (16GB, 32GB, and 64GB)I purchased the 32GB card for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and the 16GB card for another video recording device. I formatted both cards in FAT32 using Windows 7, and functioned without drama in the respective devices. I purchased the 64GB for my GoPro Hero3 Silver edition.The reason I chose the SanDisk Ultra is for the Class 10 speed rating, as well as the waterproof, shockproof, vibration proof, and X-ray proof durability. I had the 32GB Sandisk fail after 2 months of easy usage in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I don't abuse my phone and it is not subject to extreme temperature/vibrations. Sandisk replaced it under warranty but it was quite a hassle to do this.The 16GB card however, has been subject to extreme temperatures for well over 4 months: from -5F to 100F and that doesn't include solar loading from sitting under the sun, as well as 100% humidity! The 16GB card was dripping with water after I experienced water intrusion in one of my cameras, and it had been soaked in water (while operating) for several months.The packaging was easy to open by simply cutting across the top. However, finagling out the blister pack took some patience. The Frustration Free packaging is essentially a cardboard envelope sleeve with a plastic holder and the SD card adapter with microSD card inside. This is how it is shipped!Overall: 4/5 stars. Very affordable and decently fast micro SD cards. These are perfect for smartphones or recording devices used in extreme environments. However, one of them failed within 2 months. The speeds are also inconsistent. I posted a benchmark photo on Amazon showing my speeds with all 3 sizes of cards and the 32GB was the fastest.UPDATE 28 OCT 2012My 32GB card has failed after just over 2 months of use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It started dismounting/remounting intermittently by itself over night. I woke up this morning to find that the card is not readable via the phone and wouldn't work on my PC. The phone has not been abused and was not used in an extreme environment. This card was replaced under warranty by Sandisk.",4
I have this in my phone storing the majority of my MP3 collection (400+ albums). It loaded 30Gs of music comparatively fast. And never seem to have any problems with skipping or stuttering I've had with slower cards. Probably would be a solid selection for video (I haven't tried it yet) and photos save off quickly allowing follow-up shots I would have missed before.,4
"Storage prices will always go down (though I won't say at what rate over what interval of time, a la Moore's Law - I'm not that smart.) At the time I purchased it, it was a very good price for this amount of memory.  In a year's time, it will probably be a laughably expensive sum for a pittance of storage.  Oh, well.With it in my phone, I don't have to worry about the number of photos or the duration of video I take.",4
This super micro SD card was required for the Sony Action Cam that I bought for use with my Phantom quad copter. Super small and therefore easy to misplace. I like my CF cards I use for my cameras because you can hold on to them better. I like sandisk products as that's all I use.,4
My T100 Transformer read the card immediately. Nice and compact storage solution. Does the job and you won't be disappointed.,4
"Got this card in early January for my Samsung Tab2 10.1 tablet.  Within a couple of weeks, it was loading music files incorrectly onto the card.  I did not know what was wrong, but finally thought I would format card again to see if that would correct the problem.  Card would not quick format or format slowly.  As always, Amazon is taking care of the problem and I will have replacement card within 24 hours!  Hope the replacement is more reliable.  I am just writing it off as a fluke, as I have never had a problem with a SanDisk product in the past.2/14/13:  When I called Amazon they replaced it - to my door - within 24 hours!  Replacement works fine.  Now that is GREAT service!",4
I got this SD card for my android tablet. My only complaint is after the tablet installed its file system my computers would no longer recognize the SD card. Still love it.,4
"been using it for about a year now with no issues. come on amazon, how much more can i put on this review? it's a memory card.",4
Excellent product for my new Galaxy S4 phone. On-board storage has now been increased 4-fold! Would definitely recommend this product.,4
Good value. It has great speed and memory for the purpose it serves. I wish my memory was this good.,4
good card. work as describes. haven't had any issue with it or going pass metal detectors. no lost files or missing files.,4
"It's good, I liked it, works perfectly with my Minidrive, but it's kind of slow, sometimes it doesn't reach the promised 10MB/s.",4
Purchased this a few months ago and the product is still working well. I haven't had any data loss or other issues.,4
This works with my Galaxy S4 and is fast enough to record 1080P video. I would purchase again I have always had good luck with SanDisk cards.,4
Always have multiple shots at your dataI lost some photos due to a corrupt cardI used this for my phoneThe company did replace my card with no problemsBeen working great for the past few months,4
I did not do any bench tests to see to verify the read and white but been very happy with it.,4
"My wife and I just upgraded our phone to Note 3 and wanted more space.  We had the phone for 4 days now and Micro SD card works fine.  However, I feel transfer rate is slow when transfering movies from my desktop to SD card.  1.2GB movie will take about 12-16 minutes.  I have pretty high end gaming PC.  Intel I7 980X CPU, 12GB Memory, 7870 ATI Graphic card, 120GB SSD card, 3TB hard drive for storage, 1200W 80Plus Gold PUS, ASUS Sabortooth motherboard,etc.  When transfering movies or file to my WD 2.5 inch external hard drive will take 1-2 minutes.  Still satisfied, since I have more than 90GB of storage on my phone.",4
No problems I have two and I bought one for a family member. She loves it. I need four more words. I will keep buying it.,4
Easy to use.non stick and bulit well.would buy again no question.hope it last longer than the last.only issue is it's longevity.Last one lasted less than 3 years.for that price it should last longer,4
"4 stars for the excellent price and performance. Seems to be as advertised. Average copying speeds are around 18-20MB/s.Only gripe is that SanDisk doesn't include any extras - i.e. a plastic protective case, or bundle it with a SD Card reader. However, can understand why at this price point.",4
"It's pretty much a commodity product made in the Far East, but what I store on it is pretty valuable.  I feel confident in SanDisk manufacturing quality control, in the end.",4
"It arrived quickly, was easy to install, now, if I can just figure out how to save data onto it from my device...",4
"Really good deal, definitely a good way to save money  buying an item with less memory and buying one of these is a lot cheaper",4
"Great Card but poor packaging don't understand why these manufactures seem to think that putting all this plastic wrap all over the cards is good, anyway the card is high quality sturdy and quick to save and pull information from on my wife's Samsung Galaxy S3",4
We bought this for our new camera when we were expecting our first child. We use the camera about once per week (the iphone is just easier and usually takes a better picture for some reason) and we transfer the photos to our PC. It has worked well and we have no complaints so far (7 months).,4
"I tested it in several UHS-1 compliant devices and found the write speed at 11-12 MByte/Second. Sounds fine for a class 10 card but this is not what I was paying for. I don't expect it to run anywhere close to UHS-1 interface speed (104 MB/S) but it should be close to 30 MB/S as the manufacturer advertised. I have a lot more choices if I am only looking for a class 10 card.Indeed, microSD cards are usually slower than full-size SD card. They use the same Flash controller so the reason is really microSD cards use slower NAND Flash. Manufacturers know you are not going to use microSD cards in high-speed SLRs so they get to sell you lower quality NAND at a premium. My advice to you the photography enthusiasts is to buy full-size SD cards rather than microSD cards with adaptors.That said, the compatibility is great. It works great with my tablets, PCs, GPSs and phones. That is what I like about SanDisk. They do thorough compatibility tests before product release.",4
"I use this for a Raspberry Pi, in the SD adapter, and it works so far.Also appeared to be the genuine part, although the prolific Sandisk counterfeiters have gotten really sneaky in recent years.I like getting MicroSDHC cards because they can be adapted to different device sizes.  For example, let's say I buy a used phone or e-reader that needs a memory card, and I'm not using my Pi -- I can just take the Pi's card, take it out of the adapter, and put it in the other device, rather than pay more money and wait a week for delivery of a new one.",4
OH my gosh this is the greatest invention since sliced bread. I am totaled underwhelmed and it works too. xx xx,4
"Even though it's a class 10 card, writing data to it still takes a while. However, the card performs well in my phone. If you can get a good deal on this, you won't be disappointed.",4
"CompactFlash is just about perfect to use in a camera in the field. As the size shrinks, so does one's ability to easily handle the card. SD is getting marginal as far as usability in the field. Forget about changing a Micro SDHC card unless you are back at your computer! Too small to handle and easy to drop and loose!However, with the 32GB and 64GB cards, that's not quite an issue especially if you leave the card in the camera! The camera is larger than the card my a great deal. Set it down and it's a lot easier to find and handle than a micro card (shown twice as large as life when I was writing this review).My cards came with SD adaptors so that they would be useable in my work flow, a plus. Also, within the adaptor, I can use the card in devices with SD slots and download using my existing readers.",4
"You need to format this card to FAT32 before using it in your cell phone, otherwise it will not work. My Samsung Galaxy S3 kept giving me beef until I did so. It's handy to have a laptop sitting around that has a port that can take this card with its adapter in.Luckily I had one such laptop lying around. Otherwise, this card works great and holds quite a bit of space. Giving it 4 stars for the initial grief with formatting it. IIRC I used a tool called Fat32 Format, but it's on my laptop so I haven't checked.",4
"As the title says, it can cause your GoPro Hero 3 to stop recording mid recording if used at the highest resolutions and frame rates.",4
"Fast card, reliable performance.  Got this card for my Galaxy S3, no compatibility issues.  Would buy again for in a heart beat.",4
"Its probably better than I think it is. I got this to go in a Samsung tablet which is about to get replaced with an iPad. But the SD memory card portion has not given me any fits yet. The write speed isn't as high as some SD cards and this funky form factor requires an adapter most of the time, so don't expect to pop this into your DSLR.",4
"I use this in my Samsung Galaxy SIII and it has been great. There have been a few instances when the card was not recognized, but simply rebooting the phone fixed the problem. I am unsure whether this is a Samsung issue (probably), or a SanDisk issue, but it has only happened 2 to 3 times over the course of a year and a half. Overall, the write speeds are fast enough that you can record 1080p video directly to the card, which is exactly what I wanted it for. It does come with a full-size SD card enclosure, allowing you to use this in devices that require that type of memory card. Recommended!",4
Good priced memory comes in plain white wrapper and an adaptor for SD card size. It didn't forget what I put on it so I guess it works.,4
The stock memory card that came with my Motorola Defy-XT was only 4 GB and I wanted to up the memory. This works quite well and was a good buy for the class 10 card.,4
I wanted a good sized SD card for my Android phone. This one was priced well and has been working without a glitch.,4
"After having my first ever failure of a SD card, a 32GB SanDisk Micro SD card that went from apparently fine to totally corrupted in a matter of minutes, and before I could salvage anything on it. With the refund from Amazon of the 32 GB card I purchased this 64GB Ultra card as the replacement for my phone.After having problems getting the full 64 GB seen as an individual 64 GB and not a partitioned into two 32 GB files on the card, and the secret is to NOT format the card in a computer, format the card IN THE PHONE, then via USB or WiFi you can add back all the content,It is seemingly working great, seems fast with no undo lag when taking burst mode photos and I just hope it will continue to do so. I am much more contentious about backing up though, with Android, Amazon and Google pretty much all your content can be saved online and reinstalled but it takes time and is a big hassle so just backing up to a computer works great for the next 'just in case' time.",4
I'm not sure what to say other than that this product works as described by the manufacturer and seller of this product.,4
Not sure what the point is of reviewing a stanard 32G memory card.  Purchased for a tablet and works fine.,4
I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Work Pro 12.2 Tablet. It woks so what else can you say?,4
Use this in my GoPro 3 silver edition.  Even at 1080p/30 I get about 9 hours of video.  Write time is great and I have had no problems writing video to this card real-time.  I have been happy with all of my SanDisk purchases.,4
"I bought this for my Samsung Note tablet 10/1 to store movies and books. I haven't watched a full movie on it, though I have watched a full TV show without issues.  I don't really do anything else that needs speed, so I can't say how fast it is.",4
"Purchased in November 2012 (less than 18 months ago)  for use in my then new Samsung Galaxy S3.  It has never been removed from the phone until today when it failed.  Since the phone is still fine and the memory card is stored well inside, it's safe to assume this card has suffered no abuse.  Today, the card is totally unreadable.  It can't be formatted by the phone.  The PC doesn't see it at all.  It's dead, Jim.  I'll be contacting SANDISK about warranty today.UPDATE:  I've updated this from 1 start to 4 because although it failed, SANDISK is replacing it at no charge.  Sometimes stuff fails. If a manufacturer will stand by it, that speaks well.  Nice that because I bought it on Amazon I could search my orders and find the original invoice to use when I contacted them.",4
I have always purchased SanDisk products. This works alright it went bad in 2 months and sandisk replaced it. I have not had any issues with the replacement that Sandisk sent.,4
I put it in my tablet and so far nothing to complain about. Will see how long this one can last.,4
"Bought this memory card as a spare for my Samsung Tab 2 10.1.  It works great, and allows me to bring extra movies, songs, and audiobooks with me to play on the tablet when I travel on vacations.",4
"reasonable price, good quality. not much more needs to be said.",4
"Not a lot to say about it, it's storage.  I haven't done any speed tests or anything but it definitely works in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and I don't see any performance issues watching videos files stored on it.",4
"Using this in my Samsung G3 cell phone as a memory card and expansion. it works ok for now, allthough not the card but the phone itself does have a slight issue with reading massive sd cards at this high compacity. I hope that samsung will release a software or firmware update to resolve the issue with reading the card on boot up of the phone sometimes. I have found that simply restarting the phone usually resolves the issue with reading the card. or any other error messages. Overall minus the slight issues it works great.",4
"It's an sd card, this one's fast. The read and write speeds are pretty equal on this one. Approaching 20mbits per second for read and write. I installed linux to this drive for my cubieboard. Yeah, read and write speed would definitely be an ultimate determiner of over all system performance with this credit card sized computer.Sandisk makes nice stuff don't they?",4
very usefull to use in the phone also they come with the adpator to SD i will remomend it :),4
"I have 4 of these in use in different devices.  I have had no issues with any of these cards, they're all still working great.",4
Previously purchased two ADATA microsd cards one which never worked and one which failed on the second boot.So far no problems with tht sansdisk chip.,4
"I was pleasantly surprised that my card arrived ahead of schedule. That's always a plus in my book. The works without a hitch. I was able to copy the files from my 16GB card to this one relatively quickly and very easily. My Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 read the card perfectly. I have no complaints about the card although I expected the write speed to be a little faster. After all is said and done I would definitely recommend this card for your tablet, smart phone, or any other device that allows for expandable memory.",4
"Good price and fast enough to load MP3 files from the computer quickly.  I use these in Sansa Clip MP3 players, perfect match.",4
"With this card I picked up for $35 amazon's black friday sale, I increased my GNII's storage to 80GB! It transfers data at about 15MB read/write, which is well below advertised. However, this is very similar to the speed that my GNII's built in storage transfers data at, so when running large applications off of this SD card I see no difference in speed than running apps off of the phone itself.",4
It is ok for the price...but occasionally it has to be removed and reinserted or the device reports &#34;no card installed&#34; I think the contacts on these are a little flaky.,4
"After purchasing three of these (one for myself and two for gifts to others) I read reviews that said they sometimes just quit, and it's difficult or impossible to recover data.  I have only been using my own card for 2-3 weeks, but it hasn't failed yet.3/27/13 after having this in my phone for almost 4 months, the phone started chirping every few seconds, telling me it was either mounting or unmounting a card.  The SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card apparently just decided to fail.  Thank goodness I only had info for one small app on it, and only need to access it about once a week, so it's not real critical.  Thanks to Amazon's 30 day return policy though, I will probably just have to eat the cost of this one.  Unfortunately, I read the other bad reviews about this product after I had already purchased mine (2 of them, but my wife's hasn't failed YET).  My advice is to stay clear of this product, and maybe SanDisk in general.",4
"This works on my phone and is amazing, however it seems to transfer pretty slowly.  I move a lot of music and movies on and off my phone so it can be annoying.  I'm not sure if my phone or this card is the weak link though.  I have Note 2.Anyways, it was cheap and it works, that is all that matters.  Buy it!!!",4
"Really the gold standard.  I will reserve 5 stars until they blow me away on the price.  Otherwise, this is an excellent buy.",4
good scan disk but the wrong one for my camera I needed a class 6 this class 10 locks up for no reason and even will lock up my computer when it does..,4
"I purchased 2 of these, 1 for my HTC Incredible phone and the other for use in a key chain storage device. Both of these cards run very very hot.  After copying over 4GB of files, it was almost scalding to the touch.  But both have been reliable with only a few issues of reading them, both times in the thumb drive adapter, so that may have been at fault and not the card itself.",4
It was exactly the memory card I ordered. I tested it using the adapter that came with it by plugging it into my computer. Worked great.I replaced the 8 GB card already in my new tablet (a month old) with the new 32GB card and everything ground to a halt. Waiting a long time made no difference.The maximum card size for my tablet is 32GB. I guess for now it's just an ornament. That's why it was the unexpected. That's why it only got 4 stars.Update: the memory card may not be at fault.,4
I love the card unfortunately my note 2 does not allow app install on the SD therefore i have not been able to fully test this card,5
Great microSD card for your phone to upgrade you with additional 32 gigs of space.  The beauty of having a huge microSD in your phone is that you can store all of your music and pictures and stuff on there and then swap it into a new phone or replacement when that happens and not have to transfer anything over manually.,5
I bought it to expand the memory on a cheap Android tablet. It is recognized and works fine. No problems.,5
"this is a great card and product, just need to watch out for device compatibility. Got it on sale for the Samsung Galaxy Note II and it works great! Also came with an adapter.",5
"I needed some new SD cards for my new tablets. After researching I bought the SanDisk ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC Class 10. It is way better than the almost same price SanDisk Ultra without Class10!! The Ultra Class10 is lightning fast. you can see the difference when you copy large files, you will note that read and write procedures are much faster, whether you use it in camera, smart phone or tablet. The price is also ok. Only drawback I noted was that the recognized capacity is not 32GB but 29,71GB in my Asus Memo Pad. Other than that I am extremly pleased with this Micro SD.",5
The memory card works well in both my LG Optimus L9 (YES!!) as well as my Galaxy Note 10.1 Tablet. The card worked native on the Note but I had to reformat it to work with my phone (reformatting on the phone itself). It has the correct capacity and seems the correct speed.,5
"Even thoug it does not meet the specification speed, is a great product, it does what it was intended for.",5
I recently upgrade my cellphone to the Samsung Galaxy Note II super phone and needed/wanted a larger memory card.  This unit is much better than I could've every ask for with it performance and reliability.,5
"Sandisk is a very reputable company, and this class10 microsdhc card is quick.  I use it in my Galaxy S3 and it records video and photos without skipping a beat.",5
Comes with a nice little adapter for your MicroSDHC so you can use it as a normal size SD card also. pretty neat.Considering for the price at 24$ for 32gb is pretty reasonable class 10 is fast for any HD 1080p video recording or DSLR camera.I bought this for myself to use with the GoPro 3. Taking picture & Videos working great as it didn't give anycorrupted files videos & pictures yet. Its working pretty good. San-disk is a pretty reliable brand as you won't be able to go wrong with it.,5
very affordable memory with a lot of storage this was an excellent purchase that was worth it thank every one,5
"excellent product.  great storage capacity.  super fast.  delivery was excellent as alwaysPros =- everythingcons: noneputting in more so I make 20 words. not much to say, it's a perfect product.  exactly what it says it is",5
I bought this for my new Samsung G5. I installed it and the card was immediately recognized. It should be big enough for lots of music and videos.,5
I installed this on my Samsung tablet tab 2 7.0. There is definitely a performance difference on my tablet especially when i load up all my apps.,5
The sandisk ultra 32 gb is very fast. The quiality is excellent. Usefull for all device. Not problem. I recomended.,5
"I believe in generic. I tried generic. for somethings, you need SanDisk. you can trust SanDisk, it always works and if it doesn't, they will make it right.",5
"Does what it says it does, and does it like it says it will.  Installed in my Galaxy S5, no issues, and no complaints.",5
Zero complaints! Works great. My old card just quit and it seems certain cards fail on s3 and s4 devices. This one is made to work on them. Order placed and received in just over 24 hours!,5
"It's fast and not too expensive, Still works after several months, unlike a lot of cheaper cards.  You don't need this fast of a card in most phones if you just access but it makes a world of difference if you do a lot transferring.",5
Got this for my Sansa ClipZip. It holds all the songs I have on my computer from the cd's I have downloaded. Great to have for extra data when needed.,5
"I bought a new underwater camera. So my 32 GB Adata went to the camera and this Sandisk went to my Galaxy Note 10.1.  On our family vacation I took the newly purchased camera and the 32 gb Adata.  Long story short:  A lot the photos and videos taken in Cancun are gone.  Photos and video from top of a Mayan ruin (pyramid), snorkeling, family photos are all corrupted and gone.  At first, I thought it was the camera until I placed the Sandisk in and experimented with it.  This Sandisk was flawless!  I will be staying away from lesser known brands and staying with Sandisk going forward.",5
"The name should speak for itself! It comes with a regular SD card adapter. If one day you feel that you have no need for a microSD card then just simply put it back into the adapter and use it as a regular SD card for your camera or other electronics that takes a form of a regular SD card. It reads and write very fast, which it should since it's a class 10 card! I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it's a nice addition to storing those big 1080p files & MP3 music loads. Hands down the best brand in the industry for SD cards! I highly recommend it!",5
Didn't expect any problems and didn't have any either.  Great SanDisk quality at a decent price.  Speed as rated.  Happy,5
The recommended card for GoPro cameras. That's what I use it for and it works great providing outstanding performances and great quality.,5
I added 128bg with two San Disk Ultra 64GB memory cards to my PSP with a micro SDXC Adapter to the memory stick duo.,5
"my phone is still on gingerbread os, so this card is much faster than i will ever need with its capabilities. i like that it has a lifetime warranty, as my previous 32gb card did not have a warranty and is now fried after one year. for $28 with shipping this should hold me over for many years to come and has the speeds to keep up with future devices. overall very pleased. got 9mb/s write speed and 22mb/s read speed on a motorola defy xt using a speed test app",5
"I have rip music from SACD and DSD to put on this microSD and it can playback smoothly on FiioX3 Digital Audio player, no matter how big the file is.",5
"The class is how fast the memory is read.  This is a fast card.  There are faster out there, but they are far more expensive, and not worth that expense, in my opinion.  Does everything perfectly and in a compact package.  SanDisk is a brand name, and trusted by me.  Worth the extra buck, since I've used SanDisk since they made 8MB CF cards&#8230;how far we have come&#8230;",5
"I bought this for my surface rt tablet and it works great, and love how it came with the adapter.",5
"Maximize your storage now with this product. Installed easily, even for tablet new-bees. The tablet recognized it-no problem. And I'm pretty techno challenged, but have used it for picture storage and successful transferring data from the device.",5
This is a really great micro SD card! I purchased one for my Samung Tablet and another one for digital video.,5
Works just fine in my video camera in the car.  And I saved over 15 bucks over Best Buy (which always tries to rip you off).,5
this microsdhc card fit perfect in my grandsons tablet. its great to be able to download extra music and games for him.,5
Nice to see name brand things that are cheaper then in the store.  I bought this either for my phone or tablet.  You never need to worry about running out of space.  The only downside to this is if you have big fingers this thing is small and hard to manipulate for it to go in the proper way and space.,5
"I bought this for my Samsung Tab 3, my pc, camera and cell phone. It is a great little drive to store music or files on. The price was excellent as well. Fast shipping, packed well. great deal all the way around.",5
"Before using I strongly suggest to format the card, it only takes seconds. With the SanDisk I am able to transfer my images from the phone to the other phone or the tablet with no issues.My old MicroSD was from PNY when I purchased the phone they were giving the MicroSD card for free; however, it was only 2GB card. I figured that it was time to upgrade since I only had about 20MB left of space on the card, and the phone space was full due to pictures. I spend several hours doing research for a good MicroSD card.  After reading couple articles online I found that all of my devices work great with MicroSDHC.There are a lot of choices to pick from on Amazon. However, I was debating between SanDisk, Transcend, and Samsung. I started to read Samsung MicroSD card reviews, and the first reviews were from 2012 which were 1 star, at least most of them due to the card not being a class 10.  Then I looked at the Transcend card and the reviews were good., but I was not so sure about the performance test.So the third one I looked at was SanDisk, and it appears to be the best choice for my devices just because it had so many reviews. I read a lot of reviews about this SD card and I was convinced to buy it.I have downloaded SanDisk Memory Zone for all of my devices. The app provides more management functionality for complete control. It allows to manage local and cloud memory, meaning you can move files from your phone to Box, Dropbox, Google Docs, Picasa, SugarSync, SkyDrive or from the cloud storage to the phone. The application allows to secure files with a password.",5
When you are looking for a high end SD card with great write speeds look no further than Scan Disk Ultra,5
THE NAME OF ITSELF SPEAKS OUT. GO SANDISK GO!,5
"Best price I could find for a high quality Micro-SD for my Samsung S4 cell phone. Every store in the area charged crazy prices for lesser quality cards. Don't even think of buying any sort of card from your cell phone service provider. They are the worst ! Amazon all the way for cell phone accessories. Items like cases, screen protectors , Micro-SD memory cards.",5
I finally have a micro SD card that I can use to transfer pictures from my computer to my photo printer.  Works flawlessly.,5
We need lots of room in the memory card.  I think there is plenty in this card and San Disk always hss a great product.,5
Good value for the money. Performs like a SanDisk and with the piece of mind it won't fail.,5
"the site is very reasonably priced unit memory added to my Samsung galaxy no pro-12.2, 64 GB. It also helped expand the memory in this to allow for better storage of songs, information, and I believe it to be a good value.",5
"I personally got mine to expand my Surface storage and it works brilliantly, it holds all of my media: movies, tv, books, and pictures; with plenty of room to spare.",5
I bought this micro SD card for my Galaxy Note 2 about 5 months ago and its been great. Plug and play with no problems. It recognized it immediate and right after I was able to transfer 20gb of videos/music to my phone right away. The transfer speed is good and is what I was expecting from reading guides on these type of SD cards. This is a good product and I recommend it to anyone looking for a SD card.,5
great price and just what i needed i would recomend this product i think all scan disk products are good,5
"I have both a PAD and a phone. With one of these in each I can take the card out and read it directly on my computer. also if I wnat to load some pictures or movies, I just put them on the card and put it back in the PAD or phone. I don't need to subscribe to looney tunes or whatever they call it. I can just put on or take off what I want without a third party being involved. Very nice indeed.",5
"There is something to be said about SanDisk. You plug it in and it just works. I've never had one be DOA or any memory issues throughout the years, both for my camera and storage products. I installed this in my Galaxy SIII and it recognized it right away and I was able to dump my music onto it. Speed seems great as well, no complaints.",5
"Very fast! Decent price.I use this for my phone, and it does the job. Never had any problems, it's a class 10 card so it has plenty of speed for reading and writing. Will buy again =)",5
I ordered this to use with my new Samsung Galaxy SII phone.  I've used SanDisk in the past and have always had great luck with their products. I would definitely recommend this product.,5
"Great product, great speed, no hassle, plug and play. Up to now sandisk products have always been reliable for me hope this keeps up to it's brand.",5
"Shop around, and you will be surprised how good of a deal this is.Combine it with something else to get free shipping, and it's a low cost winner.Technically speaking it works great, especially for a Go Pro Camera which will benefit greatly from the enhanced storagecapacity.Put it in a digital camera, and you won't need to worry about running out of space.Just bought my second one, that's how much I like/recommend it",5
"Wanted a larger faster card for my razr maxx, running on CM11/Android 4.4.  For the price this card was the best option.  My phone had no problem using it in the default exfat partition.  Is much faster than my old card.  No problems with it.  Couldn't be happier.",5
plugged it into my Surface 2 and doubled my storage capacity.  i have had no problems with it. It is fast enough to use for videos.,5
"I've had this card for some time now and I've only had one problem with it and I believe that problem to be with my phone. The card's formatting became corrupted and while I could still copy to and from using my computer, my phone didn't recognize the card. Copying the data off, formatting the card, and copying the data back onto it fixed the issue. It's really nice to have 64GB's of extra data storage on my phone.",5
So far have not had any problems with the card.  Our movies have been great.  Beautiful color. Very clear and bright pictures.,5
"use it with my GS4,,no data corrupt/loss issues encountered. Also being Class 10 it holds true to speed claims.would highly recommend.",5
"Stores thousands of pictures, and it worked perfectly in my Lumix camera using an SD adaptor.  Recommend to anyone who wants a 32 GB micro SD card.",5
Is there any thing else that needs to be said?This was put into a Samsung S3. The card worked and has worked so far w/o any hick-ups. Price was very good too here on amazon.,5
"Plugged it into my Samsung Galaxy II, and the memory appeared - what more can I say other than it has performed exactly as expected.",5
"came in fast and managed to get it at a gold box discount, seven more words are required? thats cool i guess.",5
"I bought this for my GoPro and it does great. The only problem I experience with it is, if you download your pictures and videos from the day, you should re-format the card before trying to use it again. It seems to get confused where you left off when you re-install it. I lost out on getting some pictures and video because of not doing this on the second day of my SCUBA vacation. When I would start the GoPro in video mode, it would record about 6-15 seconds then stop automatically. Haven't have anymore problems since re-formatting after each night's downloading. The videos, set on 1080 looks great.",5
Good 32 GB SD Card.  I bought it to upgrade memory stotage on my cell.  It works on my Samsung S3.  Also comes with adapter.,5
"Great storage, has not failed yet after about a year of usage.",5
"And I hope I never do! Because of the price point and my past experience, these are usually the memory cards I go to first. I've never been let down yet.",5
"If you use one of the  larger MP  taking camera ( 12-14-16 etc)  you need this card.  Taking photos on those kinds of cameras really chews up the smaller MP cards.  Don't go on vacation without at least 1 of these babies, or you'll be having to carry lots of cards and probably end up losing one and your memories.",5
"not much to say about this, ordered it to put into my new Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet, plugged it in and it works as advertised. Nuff said!",5
Works great with my smart phone. Didn't need to format the card or anything. Just popped the card in and everything worked great out of the box. Transfer speeds are excellent with this card. I would recommend this card to everyone.,5
"Great speed on both my DSLR and Smartphones. Great Sandisk quality as usual.Although other brands may be cheaper at times, I normally look to Sandisk first, and will usually buy it over other brands unless there is a large price difference.",5
There really isn't much to say about a micro SD card: it either works or it doesn't. I bought this to install in my phone and it seems to be working fine. The fit was perfect and the performance is totally satisfactory. I've never had any trouble with SanDisk products and this will likely be no exception. It was a great value compared to places I had priced locally.,5
"I use this with my Contour ROAM on the race track, hasn't failed me yet. I would buy this again.",5
"I have buy the SDXC for Xperia Arc S even many was saying it support till 32GB SDHC, The SDXC 64GB work perfectly on the Xperia Arc S",5
In constant use on my Samsung Ativ 700t since January with narry a problem. I just bought my third one :),5
"Awesome! So much space, and it works with my phone, all i could ask for! Comes in extremely handy. Thank you SanDisk!",5
Ordered for my sons phone and was extremely happy with the card when it arrived. Would absolutely order again if needed.,5
This chip is fast & solid.There really isn't too much to say about this kind of memory.  My most appealing aspect is the fact that it has a MUCH faster access speed than many other SD cards.,5
I use this card for watching workout videos on my smartphone so I can do them outside. It works great.,5
"Works as expected, no glitches or problems. Using it with my Contour Roam2 helmet camera. Frustration free packaging was nice.",5
Product arrived on time not excessively packaged. Worked perfectly out of the box. Speed is excellent as I can play movies on it and the large file transfer time is very quick on the tablet.,5
"Bought this for my GoPro Hero 3 and am happy with the storage capacity. When formatted it gives me about 9 hours and 20 minutes of 720p video at 60fps.It's high capacity storage, it transfers quickly enough and was reasonably priced. What more can I say?",5
The SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter handles its job as you would expect from SanDisk.,5
"This item works exactly as advertised!  Those negative reviews for this product must be from people who mistakenly reviewed the wrong product or don't know what they have.  This SanDisk Ultra 32Gb SDHC micro SD card is truly a class 10, and works fine in my HTC phone!",5
"While I prefer the Pro SanDisk for my cameras, this has worked well in a smaller point-and-shoot camera, and now in my Galaxy SIII.  Plenty of room on it.  Ultra is not as fast as Pro, but plenty fast enough for my phone, including the few photos I take.  About 1 to 1.5 seconds to write to it.  Now getting 64 Gb units, and looking at a 128 Gb (expensive).",5
"its so much faster than normal sd's. I recommend this micro SD. it flies!the card reader was ok, tested it and worked but never really used it because its too big",5
I prefer the San Disk brand over other types.  This is a great size for phones & camera's.  I would buy again.,5

"I operate a commercial whitewater rafting company and we buy these bulk whilst renting out GoPro's and selling the footage along with the card to the customer. We've never had a bunk card or any problems whatsoever over about 40 cards so far. I was advised by my gopro rep to be sure to buy from a name brand &#34;like sandisk&#34;. The adapter is well appreciated by the customer, not only because most people don;t have a port for the micro format, but also because microsd is so ridiculously small that its far too easy to lose.Have and will buy again.",5
As soon as this card arrived I tested some clips I recorded in full HD video (1920 x 1080p x 30FPS) from my Canon T3i.  The card performed flawlessly.I purchased this to expand my Surface Pro's available memory and I am very pleased.,5
"The San Disk Ultra 64 GB Micro memory card works really well. The card is tiny, but the card comes with an adapter. I use it for the GoPro.",5
"what can I say besides what the title says, Plenty of memory....plug and play and a GREAT price...you won't be sorry!!!  :)",5
Sandisk class 10 as far as memory cards to me is the best! As for the price of $20+ this card is all you need for advance cameras phones ext. I bought it for my Go Pro Black edition and it worked flawlessly without and buffering error. For my money Sandisk is where I would put my money on before any other memory card...,5
I use it to store movies for my kids to watch on theirAndroid Tablet. It works flawlessly. Price finally down to earth.,5
This is about the same as what you would pay at Costco but you don't have to pay the sales tax. Same card lower price. Nice.,5
Works great (more than I can say for the GoPro).  I do pull it out an put it into my computer using that little SD adapter.  Way quicker to pull 16 GB that way (I don't know why).,5
"If you have to have the max storage on your phone... this is it. Not only is it the fastest class available, it is the ONLY decent 128 card available right now. Not a bad price, either.",5
"Like all SanDisk products I have purchases in the past, this little card works just fine in my phone and I have not had any issues at all.",5
Love the storage space.  My GS4 only has 16 Gigabytes for storage and fills quickly.  I just store all my media on the memory card now instead of on the internal memory. Transfers go quick thanks to the great write speeds.,5
I bought this memory chip for a GoPro Hero 3 camera. It works beautifully and it arrived promptly with little packaging.,5
"I put this baby in my Galaxy Note II, formatted it, and ran an SD card app to test it.  All seems to work well, maxs out my memory.",5
This works much better than any sd card I had in the past (I have class 4 off brand cards) and it is perfect for the tablet that I bought it for.,5
"Bought these for my FineVu CR-500HD dash cam, my cam cannot take cards greater than 32GB and found this to be the most consistently performing card for my use.I now get almost double the recording content vs. the 16GB card that came with the dash cam. If you need a card with no maintenance and performs with no issues, this is the card to get.",5
"I currently have all my downloaded music on this car sitting in my surface RT.  I haven't done any measurements on how fast the transfer rate of this card is, but I can tell you that it is fully capable of playing music and videos from the card to my Surface RT with no lag at all.  It was also a very good value as far as price/size/speed ratio.",5
I'm using this on my gopro.  I find that my new issue is not filling up the memory but running out of battery!  Thanks again!,5
Very fast and reliable this SD gives my GS4 so much more ability. But I am thinking about buying the 64gb so keep that in mind 32GB will fill up kinda fast if you shoot lost of photos and videos.,5
"My S3 did not recognize card when it was formatted exFAT.  S3 seems to have problem supporting exFAT format in higher capacity like 32gb or 64gb.When I inserted the SD card, it just kept saying that SD card was ""damaged"" and I just got stuck on ""Unmounting SD card"" screen when I tried to format it on my phone.I just manually formatted the SD card to FAT32 in Windows 8 and inserted it into my phone.It runs smooth now.  Seems like a lot of people are having trouble to get the SanDisk 64gb to work in S3.  Hope this helps.",5
"awesome large SD card for all mobile devices, enough room for all my music and even a few movies, buy it!!!",5
Lighting fast card and very well priced. came with backup software that allows your phone to be backed up to either a cloud service or to the sd card.,5
great price for such a super big storage. works well and so far no problem. will highly recommend for smartphones and tablets.,5
So far i haven't had any issues. It's working and is compatible with my phone. Quick shipping. Im satisfied with my purchase,5
"Absolutely great addition to my Note2. Provides plenty of fast storage. If you consider it, just buy it. Enough said - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!",5
I purchased this to use in my Samsung camera and it works great. I take picture and videos with the camera with no issues.,5
I don't know why but I just needed some space. This provided me with the space to put all my extra stuff that does not physically exist...but it exists in the realm of awesome stuff. I have space now. It worked great. I have more memory now. oh joy.,5
It does the job without any issue. I use it on my Microsoft Surface Pro Tablet. Fast and reliable. I would recommend it.,5
"This will be a very unscientific review as I did not conduct any benchmarks.Purchased this card for my Galaxy Note 2 since T-Mobile only offered the 16GB version of the phone.Review:I researched this purchase prior to buying it on Amazon so I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this card and have to jump through hoops to get it recognized by my Galaxy Note 2.When the card arrived I immediately put it into my phone.  The card was instantly recognized and the phone booted up and mounted the SD Card without any prompting.Boot seemed very fast, faster than the stock card that came with my phone.  Again, unscientifically, this card seems much much faster than my old card.  All my movies and photos seem to come up quickly without much delay.My usable space reported is 59.45GB.I highly recommend this card to anyone.  It is extremely fast and very easy to use (for my Galaxy Note 2 phone at least).Pros:-Phone boots faster-A lot of space to store movies, music and pictures-Worked the first time I plugged it in without any special hoops to jump throughCons:-None",5
"Works like a dream with my S3 smartphone, used for camera pics storage, videos and music; really enhances the capability and flexibility of any device with the slot.",5
I got this for my phone and it is working well as storage for my music and images.  I would order this again if I needed another.,5
"Holds stuff, and if you need anything further for a review then I am sorry. If you dont know that this is a memory card and hold stuff then I would recommend checking out something by Fisher Price.",5
It does what is expectected. I bougth it to use with my GoPro and it works perfectly! I recommend it!,5
"As always, this memory card just works.  I've used SanDisk products for over a dozen years and they have always worked when needed. More often, I've outgrown their capacities then worn them out.I'm happy so far.",5
I bought this to use in my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it works great.  Transfer speed is excellent and it is completely plug-and-play compatible with my device.,5
"Very fast card in my SGS3.  Sandisk always makes quality cards.  I always get read/write speeds of at least 14MB/s and 22MB/s with this card (see my uploaded pic).  Card hasn't given me any problems.  Reliable, fast, great price.  A++!!!",5
"I bought this as a gift for the hubby and he seems quite well happy with it. It hasn't given him any issues, and he certainly uses a lot of information/media on his smartphone since he is a techie lol",5
"I never thought I could have a 64 GB memory like this one, this is awesome; especially when you have a tablet. I'm using it on a Asus TF300T and it's working flawless. A piece of advise, since current tablets are not supposed to handle these, leave the format as exFAT, do not format it to FAT32 or NTFS.",5
"For the price, this helps speed up my phone significantly by freeing up memory used by the camera and apps.",5
"I've had this memory card in my S3 for the past few months without any issues. The only problem I've had with this was when I initially copied the 30GB of data from my old card to this card. I had this connected to my laptop using a MicroSD USB adapter and the copies kept failing. I figured out that the card was overheating when writing a lot of data. I was able to copy the data by pointing a small desk fan towards the card adapter during the file copy process. That being said, I don't have any read/write problems due to overheating with the card installed in my phone. I've copied over a couple of gigs of movies to watch on some trips with the card installed in the phone without any failures. It may be that heat issue only occurs after pushing &#62;3GB of data at a time. The largest movie I copied to the phone was 2GB. Most of the other movies are just over a gig.The only prep work for use in my phone was the initial format when it was first installed. The card was recognized prior to the formatting but I had seen where others had read/write issues so the format was a preemptive move.",5
"I bought the SanDisk Ultra 64 GB for my new Samsung Galaxy S4. Being that it's the faster type of memory I like to think it reads and writes fast. And I feel like it does, but it's in my phone so who knows. Now for your highend DSLR you'll notice a difference and be very pleased.",5
I bought this for my new Gopro3 black. It works wonderfully! I totally recommend it if you're looking for some high quality and speed,5
"It's inside of my Galaxy S3, and has worked great. It greatly helps expand the 16 gig internal memory, so I can store music and videos better.",5
"I ordered it for my phone to store more music and pictures.  When I first installed it my phone kept resetting until I removed it, cleaned the contacts, and reinstalled it. Everything has been fine since.",5
"This was ordered as extra memory for my wif'e's tablet. Provides lots of extra space for storage, beyond the onboard RAM.",5
"this is probably the Nth memory card I've bought from sandisk, and so far I'm still very happy. r/w speeds are decent and none have given me any troubles.",5
Great for my LG Optimus G and super fast transfer speeds. And no lagging for the games the many 3D games on my android.,5
"Out of its storage and into my new phone.  Recognized, formatted and  and available in less than a minute.  Simple!",5
Installed it to my Galaxy S4. Works great!I want more.. waiting for price to go down.. and I wish 128GB comes out soon so I can buy it,5
I reformatted it in Disk Utility on my Mac so that is FAT32. And it works very well in my device (Nokia N900).,5
"I use this card in my 7&#34; iGo GPS. The GPS came with a couple of GB onboard, but that was quickly used up by WinCE 6 and that GPS software. Since this device also plays MP3s, I wanted more space.I read the meager documentation that came with the device to see if it could handle a 16GB card. I was pretty sure it would handle an 8GB card, but one never knows with these ever-changing specifications. Unfortunately, the documentation for this device was meager and written in pidgin English.OK, I'll buy it and give it a try. At worst, I swap out my 8GB card from a different device, which hopefully will handle the 16GB card.Well, too make a long story short (too late for that, eh?), the 16GB card works just fine. I put a bunch of my MP3s on the card, put it into the device, and sure enough, it recognizes and plays them.So, pretty much a done deal. For the price, for the ease of use, for the name brand, I recommend this little card.",5
What you buy this for is in there. 32 gb fast writing speed etc. happy with product. no issues yet,5
"I needed some extra storage for my Galaxy Note 10.1. This works perfectly in my tablet and at this time, I have yet to fill it. Copying the files I want to this have been fast and reliable. I would suggest this to anyone needing extra space.",5
"I am very pleased with this memory card, I use it in a dash cam in my car. The quality of videos turn out great and I have no compatibility issues with any equipment I may use for playback.",5
I have 2 of these ScanDisk Ultra 32Gb class 10 microSDHC cards.  One for my Acer Iconia A100 Android tablet and one for my Linux laptop to move files around.  I've formatted both differently to make them fit best for their hosting operating system and both are working great.  No issues and great performance.I can stream 1080p movies from these cards without hiccups.I also used one of these cards in my 1080p camera and had no issue whatsoever keeping up with writing speed.Great card.,5
"Bought this to add memory to a 16 gig Samsung Gallaxy 3.Easy to install, and was recognized right away by the phone without need to format.Note; the SD to micro-SD adapter that ships with it, is a little tight.When I mounted the memory card in the adapter, It was tight, and very hard to remove, the first 6-7 times.",5
"They are scandisk micro SD, they work well and I have never had a problem with this product brand. short a couple words, sorry",5
"This card has met my requirements. I wanted a 32 GB card with an adapter and I wanted the faster card and it is a C10. It worked out of the box with no problem. I bought 2 of them at the same time, one for mine and one for my wife's Smartphone--Samsung Galaxy Centura. I am satisfied with both of them.",5
"Works great, good transfer speed, capacity is as claimed.Only con I can think of is that it's too small and this is the second one I'm buying because I lost my first one while playing with my phone in bed and could not find it ever again. It's probably stuck in some sheets or the bed frame, I tried but can't seem to locate it anymore. I had just discovered and saved the cure to cancer on that card and I cannot remember what it was now. Sorry.",5
Good for the price and so far it is working just fine on my phone.  Finally I can now save pics taken from the camera and things I download.,5
"i needed a class 10 micro SD card, and this small size, large memory. works just fine.  The price was very good as well",5
Great micro sd card! very helpful to store my media files and has no problem for my Samsung Galaxy note2!!,5
expanded the storage space on my 16gb note 2. Check out online to see how to make the phone think its the native space. Fast enough to capture HD video and 8MP photos. Would definitely recommend it!,5
"fast and giv, works great",5
"WORKS PERFECT WITH MY SAMSUNG TABLET, VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT, GOOD QUALITY AND AWESOME, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, FAST SHIPMENT, A PLUS",5
I paid less than $60 shipped to my door. Had it for 2mth and have had no problems after formatting it to FAT32... and its as fast as my internal  memory in my note 2.,5
Purchased this along with the Nifty Minidrive for use as my Time Machine backup my Macbook Air 13&#34;. Perfect expansion!,5
SanDisk makes a great big little card. I have this in my HTC sensation 4G ( which it isn't supposed to work in ) and I got the full memory card working. It's great to be able to cary that mush memory on a phone.,5
"This card performs much better than the lower class 4 and 6 cards I have used in the past.  I have around 400 pictures on it, as well as quite a bit of other content. Content loads very quickly on my Android phone.  Very happy with this purchase.",5
I got this for my handheld GPS. It stores data not already stored in the main memory.,5
"Good price good quality, This card works perfectly for my video recorder as well as my Canon 500D. The class 10 really bust up the speed when you need to import the photo or video.",5
Now who would have thought one day a memory card would be so small that its so easy to lose.I bought this MicroSD card to run openBSD on my beagle bone black:[...],5
"I got the 64gb card in and i just placed it in the sony cyber tx66 camera and and it ran it's preparation program for 2 seconds, and low and behold, it works perfectly. after shooting and taking hd movie and highest res pictures i used sony software download and it recognized the card at about 59.8GB. this camera could probably take the 128 micro card",5
"Price was great, Delivery was on time, now I have plenty on storage in my Gopro Hero 3, The SD card adapters makes things much easier to transfer files to my other devices.",5
"there is a lot of fake memory being sold right now, this is legit, works, and is the stated capacity. It benchmarked as fast as my device is (~10 mb/sec) This is my devices limitation not the cards I'm sure it is faster in devices that support higher speeds.",5
Quick initial test with multiple settings from 30p 1080 to 4K 15p recordings successful.Haven't done long recording field use in warm locations yet.,5
"Awesome microSD card.. no issues and I have several of these and has performed well in my gopro, SG4 and Note 2.",5
It's a memory card.  It works great.  What else do I need to say?  SanDisk always makes high quality stuff...I am not worried at all...,5
I got this to go in my smart phone and it does the job great!  Inexpensive and it includes an adaptor card so I can use it in applications without a micro-SD slot.  This expands its versatility.,5
same as I wrote for all other cards by SanDiskgood qualityworks well for long timea must for extra photos and songs in your cellphone,5
Bought it for my Galaxy S5. Dumped 32g of music on it and so far so good. It's nice to have plenty of storage.,5
I bought a SanDisk SSD for my computer.  It's fast for the price.  I feel confident that anything I order made by SanDisk will be of the same quality.,5
"Huge Video Card. Use it to back-up my netbook computer without a CD/DVD unit. Watch out for fakes. Make sure this is an authentic SanDisk card, There are fakes out there. There's a program that lets you verify yours is an auththentic card. The fake ones are really tiny drives made to look like a 64GB card. This one is authentic.",5
this memory to buy a video camera and a cell the probe with camera and battery first just the memory capacity,5
"Bought these for use in my kids' tablets, have not had any problems with them in several months of use, price was very good and transferring speeds are more than adequate.",5
It is whats it is. It does it very well. No hiccups with this disk so far. HD recording works well.,5
"Works just as it should in my Lumia 810; no issues at all. The phone is not a particularly speed sensitive application for the card so I cannot comment on how well it works under stress. The phone doesn't complain, music plays nicely from the card, pictures are written to it without delays. The red and gray design looks different and interesting, even though no one will see it.",5
"This is an ultra fast SanDisk branded SD card that's great for digital cameras, especially for video. I got it for my smartphone, mainly for the 32 GB capacity, and it fills the bill at a very low price with Prime shipping. You can't get better quality flash cards than SanDisk. I'm still amazed that they can cram such a huge amount of memory on such a tiny chip.  One megabyte of data in text from printed out would fill a pickup truck. This chip has 32 thousand megabytes.  Think about having 32,000 pickup trucks full of text in a chip smaller than your pinky fingernail!",5
"This thing works great. I have it to store pictures and videos and it works perfectly. I put it in and it formatted, and after that, no hassle at all. It was the best priced microsd here on Amazon and I am happy with the purchase. I would buy again if I needed to.",5
"I've got a number of SanDisk brand products.  None has ever failed me over the 10+ years I've used them.  That's saying something these days in electronics.This card is performing well, and keeping up with the data storage devices I am using it for (one video recorder, one scanner).  Somehow, I would expect nothing less, but then again it is good to know that quality is consistent.",5
My phone makes very high definition photos which makes a big size file. I do not transfer the files to the computer because I have plenty of space. Also it works faster than ever.,5
"With prices of tech items always dropping, getting the bleeding edge stuff usually costs a bit more. Thanks to Amazon and the ability to find deals like this, it was worth while getting the 64GB micro SDXC for my phone. I removed the 32GB I had in there for my Phantom 2 vIsion that had shipped with only a 4 GB unit.  Class 10 is where you want to be when using this for any video recording and you can always count on SanDisk for quality!",5
Este fue una buena compras ha sido todo lo que esperaba del producto. Fue un bueno producto. Llego en el momento indicado.,5
"This memory card is the best, I've downloaded it all kinds of information, without problem, and their ability to cover all my expectations. The negative is the adapter that does not work properly on the computer",5
Great price! works flawless with my note 3. I love it!!! So glad I purchased this memory card. A must have to expand your memory on your phone.,5
"I took advantage of an irresistible offer from Amazon, and this 32GB card performed like charm in my Roku.I'm very satisfied and suggest to anyone looking for fast micro cards give a look to this one.",5
"SanDisk SDSDQUA-064G-U46A Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card.  Not much to say about this card other then the fact that it is working well.  My research had me believe that this was a good and fast card and I have no complaints using it in my Galaxy Note 3.Using Samsung's 'Kies' files transfer app on my Mac, I've had no problems transferring music, videos, docs, and other files to and from this card.",5
I bought this memory card for my dashcam and it works perfectly.  I have no problems with it's write speed or resolution of video.  You can trust SanDisk for a quality product as I have many in use and have had no failures yet.,5
"It's a memory card. It holds info. 62Gigs. Can't say more. Lower cost would be good, but it works just as it should.",5
"Excellent speed and of course storage. No problem whatever with my HTC M8. Insert card, point music, photos, and apps to the SD. I see no issues at all.",5
Always happy with my Sandisk cards.  Used this one for my new Contour Roam.  Worked like a charm.....Awesome quality..Thanks Amazon!,5
It works just fine and I'm thinking of getting a 64GB for my tablet later on.  I don't have too much more to say except buy!,5
"It works just fine in my Galaxy 3s phone.  Now, I more room than I know what to do with.",5
"Very good for information or Photo storage in a small device, I have 2 so far for different computers and is great.",5
"Bought this to expand my storage space on both my Galaxy S4 and a Surface tablet with Windows RT. Performed very well on both, transferring small files can take a while but I have no problems recording video in HD with my phone. Totally recommend it, and it's the largest card both of this devices will take.",5
Great to have the additional capacity for storage. And the card is fast. Working great and the price was great also!,5
This card is exactly what I was expecting. It fit perfect in my tablet. I have enough memory to add my playlist of songs.,5
"excellent quality, excellent speed. no complaints here. very easy to use, reliable and the red stripe on the front makes it easy to find on a crowded desk",5
It works as Expected. No problems installing or anything. It fits my Samsung S4. It shipped really fast and was in packaging that I could open without the use of something sharp.,5
"I bought this card for my Galaxy S4, but with the included adapter I can also use it in my Canon 6D in a pinch. As it meets UHS-1 spec it can keep up with the cameras buffer.There are plenty of details in these reviews regarding transfer rates, etc so I won't revisit that. I have had no issues with the card overheating, it performs exactly as I expected. The price was also fantastic.I would recommend this card to anyone for a wide variety of reasons. It is fast, has a good warranty and comes with the adapter to use in regular sized SD card slots.",5
I used this SD card on my Nvidia Shield and works as advertised very quick transfer speeds.,5
Wanted more space on my smartphone.  Works great. What else can I say. Thinking of buying another as a back-up for my stuff.,5
works what more can i say . it went down 10 bucks the day after I bout it but whatever.  Great micro SD,5
"I bought this for a Sansa Clip+, it worked after formatting the card to FAT32.  Can't say much other than I have tons of lossless songs here that were previously on CDs.  What I don't like in general is that manufacturers LIE about real size of cards arguing some technical issue, it's like saying that 2+2=5, when in reality is not, this card like any other card is not 64gb, it's more like 62gb (can't remember exact size, don't have card available at hand).2+2 is not =5.  This card is advertised as 64gb yet in reality is lower, manufactures using false advertising as usual. This kinds of memory cards are a good example of false advertisement.",5
I bought this to create a larger store for my RPi Model B and it works flawlessly so far. Fast and plenty of space. A good deal for the price I paid.,5
I have plenty of space for my pics and songs that I store on my SD card. The adaptor helps in easy transfer to my laptop.,5
"it's a must to have it once u got the gopro. practical and very friendly, helps u to load as many recorded shots as possible.",5
"I bid on a 64 gb micro SDXC on ebay which never worked to start out with and realized it too late to return.  The multiple issues I had with my newly purchased Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 was caused by the inferior memory card.  All the problems with the tablet disappeared once this memory card was inserted.  Lesson learned, any technology accessories should be purchased from a reputable retailer like Amazon to ensure quality of product.",5
Nice 32gb micro sd card. Using one in a Samsung S3 and another one in a Samsung S3 mini. Both phones can use the full storage amount and read/write seems fast. Comes with a nice little micro sd to sd adapter for easy use on a laptop for transferring files.,5
perfect price for the 16gb and class 10. I used these in my raspberry PI's they seem to be very fast access and not bogged down.,5
"I made the mistake of buying a supposed 64gig card on Ebay and found that it was fake. So, I decided to purposely buy a retail packaged SandDisk card directly from Amazon. The card is great, I reformatted it to fat32 for use with my Sansa clipzip and Hisoundaudio Studio V 3rd Anniversary. I have not had any problems with the card, works as advertised and the transfer speeds are great when loading files onto the card.",5
To be the man you gotta beat the man brotha. And Sandisk is beating the man wit a stick. The price the warranty they are they are letting you steal these from them. So get your hands on some before they realize they giving out the hook up and bam they $100 again.....LOLGo SanDisk go Amazon. I bought 3 and gone buy 3 more.,5
"This is a well manufactured memory card which keeps up with demanding a/v transfer rates.  After 60 days of heavy usage, I've had no issues whatsoever.",5
"I'm not a techie, so I can't do all those great experiments to determine whether or not the transfer speed is as advertised. All I know is, the card works just fine in my Galaxy S3. So far, it has worked great, and seems to be pretty speedy.I have San Disk cards in quite a few of my tech toys, and they've always performed well. I am confident that this one will do the same.",5
"My wife and I both own Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrockets, and I bought these to replace the cheap cards that we originally used in them.  The space is wonderful, and the whole phone seems faster with these cards installed.  Very happy with this purchase.",5
"Works flawlessly, never had any problems with it and I've moved data on and off of it constantly.",5
"Not much more to say, I've tried many and these are the very best (speed, price, reliability, compatibility.)  I highly recommend these cards.",5
"bought it for my z10. now i have 6 seasons of tv soaps, over 1000 hi res pics, several short home vids and my entire music library with room to spare",5
San disk is hard to beat.  You will pay more for the brand but you get a quality product.  Would purchase again.,5
64 gb of fast microSD storage at a great price.  What's not to love?  Works perfectly with my 64gb Dell Venue Pro 8.,5
Works well no problems with SanDisk products. Always a good risk to use this brand of card. Price was right and shipping was fast.,5
"Great price! Ultra rf has high speed and good stability, which is perfect for camera.I hope 64 g also drop the price.",5
holds a lot of memory. slides right into my car cam with no problem and easy to get out as well,5
"Holds a lot of my stuff which I need, or at least I think I need, on long road trips.",5
"Do you have different devices that require either regular or micro cards?  Have you ever forgotten to bring one?  No worries if you have an adapter like this.  To get both the micro card and the adapter for one low price is fantastic.  If you don't get one, you have no one to blame but yourself!",5
they work great with my phonei think i may have to buy lots more of this productmaybe 64gb,5
"I purchased this product for my Samsung Galxy Tab Pro 10.1, and so far it's been flawless. Everything works just right.",5
"I purchased this memory card for use in a Galaxy S2 smart phone.  Music stored on the card plays without problems.  Works great and while not the cheapest, the price was not bad.********Update 11-28-12*********After about 1 month of use, the card failed.  After a few emails to SanDisk, they issued and RMA and promptly provided a warranty replacement.  On the whole great service.  These things are tiny and some failures are expected, so as long as this one keeps working, I still give it 5 stars.",5
I got this for my 3 year old's Nabi. I can put tons of movies and tv shows on this thing and keep her entertained for hours. For the price it's hard to beat.,5
"If you want tons of capacity, here it is.  Bought mine on a pretty good sale, works perfectly, as I'd expected from SanDisk.",5
Does the job. No complaints so far.,5
Works great with the HD 720P Dual Lens IR Night Vision Car DVR Camera Dash Cam Video Recorder Motion Detection.,5
I got this while it was on a deep sale here on Amazon. I couldn't pass it up. It comes with an standard SD card adapter so it'll work in your computer or anywhere else you can stick an SD card. It hasn't had any faults and does the job.,5
"My cell phone claims up to 16GB with a removable SDHC memory card, but when I bought this, it was a big gamble. I honestly didn't think it would work, being 4 times the rated capability, but it did and does. I have used it in 2 different phones, HTC and LG cell phones as well as my PC. Since it works very well in my cell phones, I expect it will work just as well in a tablet. Very happy with this purchase.",5
Very simple to format and use.  Excellent storage.  Buy it along with a 3.0 compatible USB  microcard adapter for downloading to 3.0 capable computer.  Makes for very fast and hassle free transfer of your pictures.,5
I went from 2g to this 32g card and really love it. The price is WAY lower than the Verizon stores. You will NOT have storage issues after popping this in your phone.,5
"It just works, what more is there to say.  These days every smart phone needs as much memory space as possible.",5
I bought this for my son's Samsung Galaxy MP3 player(an Android -Version 2.3 Gingerbread device) to replace a class 4 8GB. He was thrilled with the noticeable difference in performance in the device.,5
love it.  Had no problems.  I have no snags or hiccups when trying to access any data or writing data on my phone.,5
I love this micro sd card. Awesome amount of space and just plain ole reliable. You dont find to many products like that nowadays.,5
"I wanted a place to store my music on my phone. This card works great. I haven't tried the adapter yet, though.Also, so much storage!",5
"Got it fast. Works as described . Comes with management software that must be downloaded for iTunes or google play store that links all your cloud services like drop box,sky drive, and other popular account types. Great product would and did buy again.",5
Works just fine. Thia card being so big will slow down your phone a little bit but works fine for me,5
"Works great! Perfect price,I'm using mine for my digital camera, and my DJI Phantom FC40.The chip holds tons of data and is exactly what I needed!Highly recommend for anyone needing both micro and standard SD. It's great to have the ability to plug and play to get the data!Buy it, Buy it! BUY IT!For the money I should have got the 64GB card.I will be buying more.",5
Works very well with my new Tab Pro 8.4&#34;.  Have been able to download lots of content from YouTube to watch on long flights. Will use it on any device that takes sd cards.  Very happy with it.,5
Fast! Reliable! Huge storage. Already own 2 for my mobile devices. Transfer speeds are awesome. No problems to date. Great buy.,5
Works as expected! Can't complain about it has plenty of storage for pictures and videos! Will buy again when needed!,5
"I love this memory card!! I upgraded the memory on my phone from a 2gb stock card to this and, not only are the transfer rates from card to phone and back WAY faster, but the capacity is great!! I've now replaced my iPod with this because I can have all of my music on my phone as well as any games and I don't have to use iTunes to interface, just drag and drop. Oh, and it's waterproof. Like my phone. Just saying.",5
"Got it on sale during blackfriday, awesome! great speeds, lots of storage works wonderful with Galaxy Note 3. Buy today!",5
My Galaxy s3 (and me) couldn't be happier- good price arrived quickly and what can I say - it does what its supposed to do!,5
when I got my phone I didn't know about 6GB out of the 16GB would not have been available to me from the start because of its operating system and all the software that was pre installed so I used this to get more than enough memory for my phone and it works great I have all my music a few movies and all my pictures and all my ebooks on it,5
"Works great in my Samsung Galaxy S4.I also use a SanDisk card in my DroidX, after some bad experiences with another manufacturer's 32GB micro-SD card that occasionally flaked out.Beware imitation cards that may look almost identical.",5
"A name you can trust.  Good price, now I just have to figure out how to use it in my Note.",5
"I haven't had any problems with this card.  I use it with my Galaxy S3.  The transfer speeds have been quite fast and I didn't have to format the card.  Between this card and my Dropbox, I don't ever foresee me running out of space.",5
"Picked up a couple 32gb cards only because the 64gb cards are still expensive and or out of stock (I try to buy only from Amazon directly or fullfilled by amazon for faster shipping).  I have many many SanDisk cards from microSD (in our smart phones), SDHC in our point and shoots and surveillance cameras, and compact flash cards for my 5D.",5
"Bought two of these to use in a pair of Galaxy S3 phones. Fit perfectly and were instantly recognized by the phones. Lots of room now for photos, etc. No problems at all thus far. I have quite a few SanDisk memory products, including their 128GB SS drive. All have been trouble-free, so I am hopeful.",5
"great deal fast data good price . you can use it for any thing . you dont need card reader , it comes with one already",5
"I needed to get more space on the SD card in  my phone, so naturally! I turned to a product I know for its quality and attention to details.  I want to be sure my photos and other data are held in a safe place.  For the money, you cannot beat this product and I will buy again.",5
"Perfect card, all you need to keep all the action in this 64gb. I acquired this card for a GoPro camera and fits perfectly, its all you need to capture all the action when you need it.",5
"With the small 16 G onboard memory in this Tablet, the added 32 makes it pleasurable for textbooks, music and pictures.",5
Got this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Recognized it immediately. Seems to work fast for the pics and videos I've taken. No complaints. The price on these things fluctuates quite a lot. I would recommend to use a price tracker (camel camel camel) on this before purchasing or at least pay attention to the price a couple of days of purchase. The price had dropped by fifteen dollars after it shipped. Amazon's awesome customer service refunded the difference without any trouble. Thanks!,5
"Turns my smartphone into an iPod effectively! You can store music, pictures, videos and more on it. It can be accessed directly with an adapter or indirectly via micro USB to USB (2.0, 3.0). Would highly recommend!",5
I bought this card so I could have some storage that was quick.  This card delivered.  That's about all there is to say.,5
"the micro card was a snap to insert into my tablet and now i have the extra storage should i ever need it.  i use sandisk cards on all my cameras also 'cause they're quality products, and i got this one for a great price too.",5
I use this with my samsung galaxy note 3 and it performs pretty darn well. Write and read speed safe good and it stores all my photos no prob.,5
Hard to know what to say exactly about a memory card except that it does what it should at a good price.  Storage case is sturdy enough.,5
"Just as advertised this microSDHC card works perfectly with our new smart phones, allowing LOTS of apps!  Highly recommended!TRY it, you'll like it!",5
"Whether I'm on vacation or just taking photos and videos around the house I don't trust any other memory cards to keep all my memories.  I bought this card mainly for my Contour ROAM 2 Helmet Cam, but I've been using SanDisk Compact Flash Cards in my Canon DSLR and SanDisk SD Cards in my Panasonic HMC40 video camera and I've never had a single problem.  They don't fail, I've never had a file corrupted, they've survived x rays at the airport and extreme weather conditions.  Sometimes I'm tempted with the prices of other memory cards but in the end I go with the SanDisk for that warm and fuzzy feeling of knowing all my photos and videos will be perfectly safe.",5
Added lots of storage space to my new Nokia Lumia 1520. Very nice! The package got here very quickly and I was able to install it easily. The phone recognized it immediately. I did turn off the phone before inserting the SD. It came with an adapter that I didn't need to convert it from Micro SD.,5
I have used this to store recorded video information from a dash camera.  I have had no problems so far.,5
I purchased this to use with my Samsung tablet. It works perfectly and stores a lot of information. I would buy this product again. SanDisk knows how to make memory cards that last!,5
Easy install in to the S4 and expansion of memory was completed with out issue.  Product works as it is advertised.,5
Many devices still don't work well with 64GB capacity cards. These 32GB cards are often available on sell for a great price and work fantastically.,5
I use this in my Galaxy Note 3 and seems to work just fine.  I love having lots of memory and the price was good.,5
"Bought 3 for the kids tablets for christmas.  All 3 worked perectly,  I would definitely buy again if the need arises",5
"this is my 10th SDHC card.  I bought Sandisk only. good quality, good brand. recommend to friends. used in Galaxy Note 10.1",5
"Bought this because I discovered that I had accidently left a class 2 card in my phone for over a year. Was troubleshooting the sluggishness and realized my error. This card, while not officially supported, works perfectly fine. I partitioned it using the ROM Manager. Also installed Link2SD and moved the largest apps to an ext2 partition.",5
"Fast, reliable, plenty of size for the money. I ran Sandisk memory zone on this and was reading between 22 and 29 mbps. Not quite the 30 that it is supposedly rated at, but that is with a lot of apps installed and running off of the device.",5
"I use this card to back up some of the files, that I have on my work computer (at home).  and be able to use them on my laptop computer",5
Love it in my new Samsung Galaxy S5 phone.,5
"I use it for HD video recording, It work very well, no frame lost since I use this card. I have no measured the actual transfer rate, but it looks to be very fast when reading the movies from the SD, and I have no frame lost since I use this card.",5
"32 GB Micro SD chip. If this is the size and memory amount you desire, this memory card has never failed or had errors on me. 5 stars for that and being the cheapest I could get at the time.",5
"Nice product, perfect package and speed of recording. My camera will stay better with this memory. I recommend for all.",5
Fast and reliable.  Well worth the price.  Works in my android tablet 7.0 with no problems.  Setup was no problem.,5
Excellent card. It is currently installed in my Samsung GS3 and works flawlessly. Highly recommended but make sure your phone/device will handle the size; some don't like cards &#62; 16GB.,5
the card arrived promptly in good condition. i don't use exfat so i reformatted it to ntfs but fyi some for example cameras only recognize fat32 so keep that in mind. i have used this for a few months now and have had absolutely no issues. a great value imho.,5
Very fast and does the job. I have placed this inside of my LG Optima Pro and it works great. The price is right.,5
"When the wife's Macbook Air SSD got full, I dropped in one of these with a near-flush mount SD adaptor (also via Amazon) and set it up as a second drive for her iTunes collection. Now she's got plenty of room for pics of the kid.",5
Disappointed that the Acer netbook could not read the 32GB microSDHC using  included adaptor but the memory card functions perfectly in Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus Android telephone.  Moved large video files very quickly.,5
I bought this product in order to use with my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet. It works as advertised and allows files to be stored on this memory instead of tablets memory. I re-formatted it to use NTFS mode and have not noticed any problems.DS,5
"I got a new phone and this was part of a dock and battery deal so I pulled the trigger. So far transfers have been fast and successful. It's only been a few months, but it just works.",5
"I a using this card with a Sansa (sandisk) mp3 player and it is working flawless. I am glad, but I cannot imagine what could go wrong with a card like this, either it works or it does not, and mine is working. Anyway, I would buy one of these again without a doubt.",5
Excellent storage and small!  Works well and does everything I need it to plus it came in at a good price.,5
Bought it for my Surface Pro. I've had it in there for a few months and I've had no problems. Very fast and stable.,5
It fits in my phone. It holds lots of stuff. It comes with a reader that works in my laptop.,5
"Great product, great price, great quality!  I've purchased 6 of these so far for family and friends.The only thing better than this would be a 128gb model!I only wished that laptops came with micro SD slots!",5
Gave my galaxy S4 plenty of memory and at a good price. I had a problem with my first one but Amazon sent me a replacement next day which worked perfectly.  I would recommend this to anybody.,5
"the best quality there is in memories is super fast, wonderful and cantiad of gigas is very good, the best brand and speed",5
Nothing much to say here. Works great and I haven't lost a single picture or video saved on here so far. Read/Write speeds are excellent.  I've been using this for a few months on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and I have no complaints.,5
excelent,5
"I needed this for my Samsung Galley tablet. It's doing the job it was needed for. I really didn't need the adapter, but most all micro SD cards come with them.",5
"I received this on Friday, followed the review from another person about formatting the disk before using it, and after the format, it did it's thing!  I have a Motorola Droid RAZR and have seen a huge improvement.  The phone is much faster.  The apps open and close much faster.  That also goes for the camera.  I highly recommend this and worth the price.  I haven't placed any music on the it yet except for pictures on my phone.  Cheers.",5
This product provides me with a stable and compatible storage augmentation for my Android tablet.  A true asset to my needs,5
"I purchased this to expand the internal memory of my smart phone, specifically the Galaxy S3.  It performs absolutely flawlessly.  If you have any reservations about this micrSD...don't. There's no need to format since it comes pre formatted. Should you desire to format,  do it from within the phones settings and again, no issues.  PLEASE, turn the phone off and remove the battery before installation...lol",5
"I bought this specifically for my COWON J3, as it comes with 32gb of internal memory, adding 64gb got me almost to 100gb. That's 3x the original capacity that player has.This card is formattable to FAT32, thus allowing you to use it with some of the older SDHC devices. I know not many of the buyers will even consider this ability, but I figured I'd throw it there for those that might be interested.The card is fast, I'd post benchmarks but you can just google for a ton available already. Also with 30mb/s speeds this wouldn't make a bad Camera SD card if you absolutely needed one someday. Just stick it in the SD adapter and you're rolling.I tested it with my Canon T3i, worked flawlessly, however, not as fast as my other 90mb/s card.",5
"Recently upgraded to Samsung Note II. I've been wanting to carry more of my music. Turns out I only had a total of 12GB of music. But with the new 64GB card, that still gives me another 52GB for my photos, spreadsheets, word docs and PDF docs. I've been listening to my music stored on this card--No delays.",5
"I just popped it in my Sony Xperia Tablet Z .  It works.  There is no sense that I will ever run out of room.  If I was using it for work that might be different, but I could just change with a new micro sd card.  I don't know why all tablets don't have a port for one.  I feel confident with the SanDisk brand.  I have never bought a bad SanDisk product.",5
"I bought this to put into a wifi enabled USB flash drive. It works fine. I can get my entire CD collection on it, which was my goal.",5
"I bought this card for increased storage on my Galaxy S3. I had zero issues using it this way. If you're contemplating doing the same, ignore the theoretical limits you're reading about. The 64 GB card works fine on Galaxy S3and the entirety of the card is recognized, not just the first 32 GB.",5
"This is the second one of these chips that I received.  The first either had a latent physical defect or damage in transit, but it snapped in half on first use.  I was really bummed, but determined to try again.  This was a breeze!  The chip blazes, doubled the capacity of the 32 GB chip it replaced in my ASUS TF700T tablet, and holds ALL of my music and documents with plenty of room left over!  I now have 128 GB available on my tablet, and it all works flawlessly.Anyone that is looking to upgrade needs to do a little due diligence in determining that your device is able to address 64 GB's, but with that reservation, I strongly recommend this little gem!!",5
"Nowadays this memories don't have the fastest write speed, but even tho those are good speeds.On the other hand, SanDisk is a good mark.And, what adds even more value, imo, it's that those specific memory cards have a lifetime warranty.I got one damaged in 1 year, and they changed it.I really like this warranty service.",5
"Sandisk is the best brand in my oppinion. 32GB is a great size to put music, video etc. Recommend it!",5
"So, essentially you have about 28 - 29 GB, but it seems to be quite a bit for me. I have yet to use even a quarter of that, and I take pictures every week. I had a problem with how it transferred some videos to my computer once, but that my be because I forgot to format it and prepare my tablet for removal of the SC card.It is definitely surprising how small it is! Be careful not to lose it!",5
It works great and transfers quickly. I use it on my Dell Venue Tablet and my Polaroid XS100 action camera.,5
This item works great as expected without any issues. I would recommend this item for anyone in need. Good buy.,5
"I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  It works perfectly with no strange behavior, great speed, and the SanDisk name to back it up.  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend.",5
Perfect counterpart for the Microsoft Surface RT tablet. Supports Bitlocker encryption so you can keep it password encrypted in case you lose it. I have no issues playing HD videos from it using the Windows 8 default video player.,5
"It has worked fine, so I have no complaints.  I've purchased SanDisk products several times and have been happy with this brand.",5
This is what I needed for my tablet and it works great. I will buy two the next time. thank you .,5
"no problems so far using it with the included SD adapter on my micro 4/3 camera, no problem when shooting 60p HD video!so far so good!",5
What can you say.  It is a memory card and it works.  The price was good for the size of card.,5
"Plenty of room for all my photos, music and random documents I decide to load onto my phone. It works great with my HTC One M8 and apps stored on the SD card run as smooth as they did on the phone itself. File writes were as fast as I expected from an XC I card.The only downside, and this is minor, is the MicroSD adapter it comes with seems a little cheap. But hey, that's not the reason I bought this card.",5
Memory card works awesome and for this much memory for the price is awesome. I use it for my GoPro but you can use it for anything that can take a micro SD. Comes with the bigger SD card so you can put it into a card reader or computer that reads SD cards.,5
"It amazing how much data they can fit on these tiny cards these days.  When I saw this 32gb class 10 card for $20, I snatched it up for my 10&#34; Android tablet to hold my library of kids DVD movies I converted to tablet video for my kids to watch while on the road.  It works great and the kids love it.",5
I needed a micro SD card with more storage for my phone.  This was a good price for a lot of space.,5
"As per other's instructions, I inserted it in a powered-off phone and let the phone format it (automatic, after a yes/no dialog). I removed it from the phone and copied  my old card onto it through a card reader on the PC (plus about 20 movies) and everything is working perfectly. Speeds seem outstanding; certainly, copying a 3GB HD movie I copied from my Blu-Ray disc took only a few minutes, even over USB 2.0.",5
Works great in my Samsung Note 2 and Samsung Ativ 500T. Just slide it in and nothing else to do!,5
"This was purchased on a special and the price was right!  It works great, plenty of storage space, and the great price sealed the deal!",5
"Works like it's suppose to, quick and efficient, stable and reasonably priced. So far so good, put it in the camera and go.",5
"I've had the SD card for over 6 months, and use it in my Galaxy S4.  It has never had any issues, it transfers data pretty quickly and 32GB is a good amount of space.  Great price too!",5
"What can I say?....speed, quality, good price...I recommend it to everyone. Be aware you need to turn off first on Windows to removed it...is expensive to forget this...",5
"I bought this memory card for my galaxy note 2 phone. I saved a lot of money by purchasing the 16gb phone and just buying this memory card. I haven't came close to filling it up yet, but when i do, i'll just upgrade to the 64gb version of this card. great product! fast shipping! great price!",5
"Bought for GoPro but use for other HD camera also. Very dependable, have owned many without failure. Never had a SanDisk failure.",5
"Memory cards are almost commodity items now, but I still prefer name brands with 5+ year warranties.  Had a problem with a Sandisk a while back, and they replaced it under warranty without any hassle.",5
I replaced a 64GB card in my note 3 with this 128GB card and everything seems to be working just fine as expected.  I've been using the card for about a week.,5
so fr it been great  i need it for my not 0. 2014 table  too bad it cost so much but  it is what it is,5
"SanDisk is well known for their microsd cards. I placed one of these 64GB cards in my Galaxy Note II and love all the extra storage on my phone for video, music, work docs, etc. Haven't had any issues with the card thus far and it has been working great in my Note II.",5
Love the micro sd card. It's everything i wanted and needed. The packaging was hassle free and easy to open,5
"We have bought two of these.  You get an open slot with your smartphone and you should use it.  Pictures, movies, and music will fill up your primary device storage in a heartbeat.  Further, it is a good practice to have your &#34;personal&#34; stuff, like the things I just mentioned, saved to an external drive so as to not be in the mix should the horrific happen and you have to get your phone wiped.Word to the wise:  ENCRYPT YOUR STORAGE, both Primary Device and External SD.  For the Samsung Galaxy S4 (at least), that, in turn, requires that you use a phone unlock code of at least SIX characters, with at least one of them being non-numeric.  I know this can appear to be a pain in the butt, but the first time your device is ganked and you aren't panicking because your stuff is encrypted, you'll thank me.  Nekkid pictures aren't the only things of concern, mind you.  An unencrypted device, stolen by the wrong hands, isn't just $25 in crack cocaine money...it is much, much more than that in terms of lucrative identity theft opportunities.  Don't be &#34;that guy&#34;.  Encrypt your phone.  There are walk-throughs showing how to do that for whatever device you happen to have on YouTube, I am certain.",5
"I use it on my phone, it works well enough. Android doesn't like to use the card by default, so I have to move things manually, but that's beside the point. The card works well.",5
This product was formatted and installed in a GoPro Hero 3 Black. I get 4:30 hours of recording time on 1080p 60fps. No issues so far and don't expect any since SanDisk is basically the standard for solid state memory.,5
"great price especially for the size and speed, this maxed out my Note 2 smartphone and I am very pleased with the speed of delivery and the cost.",5
Good pair of micro sd card that i bought for my m4/3 camera and phone. Have been using it with my Olympus OMD ME5 camera for a while and before that a Sony Nex 5N and my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. No issues so far and the price is just right.,5
Hopefully these will get cheaper but worth every cent to have more recording time I used 5 of these for Christmas work great and you have good eyes !!!,5
The card arrived promptly and has worked flawlessly in a dashcam. Would recommend purchase to others if they need this kind of card.,5
"Tha memory card works great, i havent had any problem with it, i recommend it for a gopro H3 camera",5
It came in a reasonable amount of time and was exactly as I ordered. No pretty lights and no stunning sound. Just a reliable memory card that worked and has not failed.,5
Card works fine with no hiccups or issues. Speed of card is fine with the dash camera and download to laptop.,5
"work as expected. very fast. actually is installed in a HD car camera (DVR) and recording every day, every move. good product. 100% recommended.",5
No comment - bought for a friend.  No comment - bought for a friend  No comment - bought for a friend.,5
"I ordered this for my son and he loves it. More memory space than the one I have of 32. I plan on getting another one for me because I love to download a lot of videos, music, and take pictures",5
Purchased two of these as they are the best. Yes there are faster SanDisk cards but this works just fine in the Note II .,5
I inserted the 128gb Microsd card and it works great. I didn't even have to format it. My tablet see 119gb which is still good. Once I read the reviews about the card it made me think second about it. SanDisk fixed all the issues they had in the previous years to the point where all I have to do is stick the card in the slot and the space is available. GREAT JOB SANDISK for listening to people's complaints and fixing issues in the past.,5
Got this memory card for a good deal. I'm using this on my samsung galaxy s4. So far I never filled up the memory card and still have at least half of free space on this card.,5
"As soon as it was inserted into the Samsung Galaxy S4 it started getting filled up in a trip to NYC. It is great not having to empty photos and music off the phone, and the phone still works fast, which is good considering SD cards with apps tend to make Android phones slow. Great quality from SanDisk!",5
Just wonderful. Perfect for my new phone. Does what it is designed to do. Fits in fine. Works very well.,5
the only reason not to buy this one is to buy the bigger one. Ive had in my phones for over 2 years and is awesome. Never worry about running out of storage. Great product!,5
"I knew I was going to purchase a New Samsung Note 2 phone and I purchased this long before I actually needed it. I'm very pleased I did because I finally got my New Phone, added the memory and I'm very pleased so far. With the Holidays near, I plan to take lots of Photos and Videos with my New Phone and the Extra Memory will be very helpful.",5
this card is great you can save lots of pictures or files on this card the card works great in most phones,5
"This SD works as its supposed, I have it in my phone right now and have had it for months. No issues!",5
I have a point and shoot camera.  This works well with it. Have no problems so far.  I think my camera is the speed limiting step rather than this card.,5
"I am very happy this come very fast, good packed, I usually used but its fantastic so fast with my new cards",5
Works great.  Great for video capture since it is a class 10 rating.  Works as it should and the shipping was fast as well.,5
This does exactly what you would expect from a 32GB MicroSD memory card. Plenty of storage and fast access times make this a solid purchase.,5
"This is the cat's meow.  And the best song from stage play &#34;Cats&#34; was &#34;Memories&#34;.  If you keep forgetting things, get more memory.  Just  remember to format it in your device before use.  (I think I forgot to format my  brain before use.)",5
Arrived fast.  Works with all my digital devices no issues.Haven't tested the speed yet but should be more than adequate for data transfer.,5
"We can't beat Class 10 flash memory speeds, at least for now.  This unit works assuringly F A S T and reliably ... for a reasonable price, too.  I have no hesitation in recommending it ... or buying the SanDisk brand, again.",5
"either it works or it doesn't -- it works, it was a fair price and I am happy with it",5
"Noticeable improvement to my Sprint HTC EVO LTE with this.Camera app used to have bad pictures when I shot in burst mode (several frames per second). With this card it never misses a burst picture.Also apps that have been installed to the SD card are a lot more responsive.Update:Card has died on me, as of May 12th 2013. I originally ordered this October 22, 2012. So I got about 6 months out of it. Oh well.",5
I wanted extra storage for my phone and this 16 GB is a perfect fit and the price was quite reasonable plus it comes from a quality manufacture of memory products.,5
"I bought the memory to my lumia 620 and it works. It's really faster than my previous microsd (Class 4). No complaints, i'm very happy with my purchase.",5
Great micro card for my wife's Moto Defy XT.  Lot of breathing room to install apps and take pics and vids.,5
"I purchased this to increase the storage on my tablet. Plugged in and worked immediately and was very affordable. I am not a tech expert but it seems to have no problem saving large video clips and playing them back. There was 1 cheaper than this, but this seemed to have better reviews so I went with this one. It was about half the cost of the cheapest one I could find at the big box store.",5
"32gb, this is just what the doctor ordered. Take 32gb and call me in the morning..The ultra runs fast and has lots of capacity for your electronic needs. Seller is great getting package out quick. Price was right! Highly recommened..",5
So far so good. Fit right into the slot on my Samsung S5,5
"Solid card, used for music on phone and apps, but has been standing in on my DSLR and has functioned great for the purpose. Got the card at $20, which was a bargain, and it's finally full.",5
"I haven't done much to speed test this device, but it does everything I ask it to and the price was right.",5
OK so far with my Samsung Galaxy S3. I initially received one that seemed to have an issue. It would intermittently save a photo here and there that would become corrupt a short time later. (The DropBox auto upload was fine so I know it was stored OK initially.)Amazon (excellent support) quickly shipped out a new one. The replacement has been working great so far! No sign of the issue I had with the first one.The only con is the time to display contents and read it in MTP mode if it has a lot of files.*** This is NOT the fault of the card. It's a known issue with phones in MTP mode.Note to Rooted GS3 users...I also tried putting the phone in the old unmounted USB mode. I was unable to read it but was able to read a 32GB version of the same card. It appears the GS3 does not support over 32GB in the old USB mode. Possibly part of the reason why they did not include a USB option via phone settings.,5
perfect memory card for cell phone use; great amount of storage and has really good read/write speeds. would recommend to others,5
Bought this to download more songs and music from spotify for my phone. Totally worth having the extra space since spotify won't save songs to your phones internal storage.,5
Works great for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  Just plugged and played.  Didn't have to do anything special.  I would recommend.,5
"The subject says it all.  Does what it's supposed to do ... at a great price.  When it's on sale, buy it.",5
I use the card with GoPro Black Edition and it is just enough to record some action while horse riding. I have always used SanDisk as recording cards and I am happy with the quality I get.,5
"and the price is economical for the size it is, purchased this for my GO-Pro HD cam, works great adn the adapter allows me to instantly transfer the movies and pics to my computer.",5
"Decent price on 16 GB. Works as it should, no problems. Not sure if the speeds actually matter with mobile devices. Maybe for transferring media to PC faster actually helps. Either way, it works great.",5
"The Memory SanDisk Ultra 64GB Micro-SDXC Class 10 UHS it has been working really good and it is fast at loading my content i would really recommend this product to anyone that needs a memory card for their phones, tablets and more.",5
"64GB is pretty good size, and in a cell phone, it's awesome. However, getting it formatted as FAT32 is not the easiest method. By default, Windows 7 will not allow anything larger than 32GB to be formatted as FAT32. Even if you execute a DOS command to format to FAT32, it will fail. There is a fix though. Ridgecrop Consultants Ltd has a program that can be downloaded. I would suggest that you support this free application by sending the guy a few bucks, as he has truly written a great program that works very well in Windows 7. I have used his program, &#34;fat32format&#34; to successfully format this 64GB MicroSDXC disk. I then copied all of my contents from my old 12GB disk to this one. I inserted the disk into my phone, and whalla! It works great! Very pleased with this purchase.",5
"fast, used it on my dji phantom gopro hd black, not one hickup.i would buy again only cheaper. you get whacha pay for",5
Works Perfectly!!!  Couldn't ask for a better card and price was good too. got two one for each smart phone and my Wife loves hers too finaly got lots of free space.SanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter...,5
Brilliant Little Card  Good Transfer speeds highly recommend to all was exactly what i was looking for at a great price.,5
the phone that memory resides plays video and media fast.  Sandisk always makes excellent products and for memory it is leader.,5
"Great card. just what I was looking for, for my surface. Now I need nine more words for Amazon limit.",5
this does excatly what i bought it for goes in to my phone and is a nice storage comes with a micro sd to sd converter so it was a nice buy,5
"this is my 3rd sandisk micro sd card for my 3rd android device, and just like its predecessors, the Ultra 64gb micro SDXC class 10 worked flawlessly in my SCH-I605 Samsung Galaxy Note 2.i simply inserted the card, power-cycled the device, and once rebooted, the Note 2 recognized an unformatted sd card and asked if i would like for it to be formatted in order to be read. once i chose YES, i now had an additional, fully usable micro sd card that i use for media and ebook reading storage.the response time is excellent, so i have no complaints on performance.i also love the fact that i ordered this at 3pm on Thanksgiving day when i was alerted of the $39.99 price tag.",5
"All I did was install this into a Galaxy Reader gizmo, and it worked perfectly with no fuss.  I returned a different kind (also SanDisk) that didn't work at all.  This is the one to get.",5
"I purchased 2 128GB SD cards, one for my Nokia Lumia 1520, and another for my Surface Pro 2, both devices took the card without any issues.As for read/Write speeds, I am sure there are better options, but this is the only 128GB Micro SD card available right now, and Sandisk did an amazing job with the product.And currently at $119.99(For how long, I am not sure), it's a great deal, considering a lot of the good SD cards are in the $140 range still.No issues with either card unmounting itself, put them in, transfer files, and you're good.",5
It installed and is working without any problems in my Samsung Note 2.  Price was  very good for the price.,5
Got it for my Note 10.1 and it's great being able to pop it into my computer via the adapter to load large amounts of pictures on and then back into my tablet. Kinda wishing I got a larger capacity one.,5
"No issues, plug and play.I have not run benchmarks, but I do store all of my camera and video data to the card. This includes a lot of high definition Daily Roads dashboard cam footage. There's no issues caching all of the temp video files, or storing the ones I opt to save due to the apparently speed and capacity of this card.The only con is the fact I waited so long to buy one. :)",5
"items like this, they either work or they don't so in that regards, whether it worked or not is about all you can comment on in a review.  For me, it worked just fine and the camera never hit buffering moments that slowed down shooting performance.",5
"I had a cheap 8 GB SDHC card that just would not behave itself in my Android phone and kept throwing errors and becoming corrupt. I looked into getting the 64 GB Sandisk Ultra, but read about all the problems on the XDA forums that people were having and went with the 32. I wish I had a 64 GB capacity to be honest with the rate at which my SGS3's camera can suck up storage, but it's sufficient, and most important, extremely fast and reliable. I've never had an error and never had to format it. Plugged it in and it was ready to go. You get what you pay for.",5
"What can you say about a chip? It works, it's fast and has been trouble free. A great product at a great price.",5
no problems at all. works great,5
"stores a lot of HD pictures and videos. no longer do i have issues with SD card errors and losing my data. i highly recommend anyone buy class 10 SD cards for their devices. have had this for 5 months, no issues.",5
"What can I say? It's the best price I could find for a 64 GB micro SD, and it works great in my Samsung Note 3. When I finally decide to buy a Note 10.4 or Note Pro 12.2, this 64GB card will be ordered right along with it.",5
"Good amount of space for the stuff I want to do, and fits in my GoPro. What more can I say?",5
"Works good with Nokia Lumia 822. Has plenty of space for music, pictures and especially for movies at high resolution.",5
This is great. I use this with my Contour Roam camera. Works great. lots of room for video. Transfer speeds are as expected.,5
I bought this memory card for my Samsung Note 10.1. i amis really happy about it and i am recommending this product & am very pleased about it.,5
Using this on my Samsung Galaxy S4.  It works well and has good read/write speeds.  Very pleased with this card.,5
"Put the memory card in my Microsoft Surface RT and it worked fantastic. No formatting, no setup, it was ready to go right off the bat, plus the price was the best I could find anywhere.",5
"This was immediately recognized by my Windows 8.1 laptop. I had to re-format this from ExFAT to FAT32 in order to have it be recognized by my Samsung Note 2 and my 7&#34; Android tablet.It took a long time to transfer 25 gb of video files from laptop SSD hard drive over to the SdXC card--I imagined that it would happen more quickly. .. but it did work smoothly.Overall, this is what I wanted and it was a great deal for the price!",5
I bought this to stretch the capability of my LG GPad 8.3 GPE tablet.It is working just fine and of course I have total confidence in SanDisk storage items.,5
"I bought this for an Atrix HD. The specs say maximum 32Gb, but 64 works fine with a formatted capacity of around 58GB.I did a speed benchmark here (I don't know if Amazon strips links)[...]",5
"As soon as I saw that this card was announced on the various tech sites out there, I knew that I had to buy one.  I went to Amazon and picked one up for $120.  This is a steep price compared to 64gb cards, but this is the largest capacity commercially available.  And I don't want to be swapping out micro SD cards.  That is just so inconvenient.  I did various speed tests on this card and can confirm that you can get 30MB/s+ read speed.  Fastest I saw was a little over 40MB/s.  Write speed varied greatly and seemed to decrease the larger the file got.  Minimum write speed i saw was just under 10 MB/s.  I use this on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and have not have any issues with it.",5
"I got this for my ELPH 520-HS camera. Amazing capacity for such small size. I also got the adapter so that I could download all the photos directly, and quickly, into my computer without needing a cable.",5
cant complain about anything sandisk.  I buy this product anytime I need a memory card.. prices are decent and storage capacity is as well,5
"There is not much to review other than how it works - so far it has been just as hoped.  The read/write time is very fast, and I have had no issues.  I am currently using in a camera and it give basically unlimited pics and video due to the size so is great when travelling.",5
Well my sister and I got new phones.  So I didn't want to use our old memory cards.  And from what I could tell this product represented the best combination of speed and price.  Plus I'm familiar with SanDisk brand.  They have been working perfectly for us for about a month now and I don't expect that to change.,5
Couldn't find this in the local stores. It is what we needed and it was brand new as stated and works great.,5
installed this big baby in my S4 lay night and it is rocking and a rolling did first test think I got 26mb read which I am plenty happy with I was moving things onto the card also I think so not sure how much faster it can go computer I am sure it will be faster,5
Its a good price and have never had any issues with the card deciding to stop recording. I have used it in a Hero3 and 3+ always recording in 1080p at 60fps.,5
"I'm amazed.  I ordered this from Amazon on Tuesday morning, and it arrived with Wednesday's mail.  VERY impressive service from Amazon!As has already been reported, the card formats out to > 59 Gb, and it performs perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy S III (which is also new).  Using two card readers on a fast PC, I transferred everything from my old 16GB card to the new 64 GB card in less time than it took to walk to the kitchen and get a cup of coffee.  So I think the Class 10 rating is correct on the card.Once I have some experience with the card in the phone, I'll benchmark the card and I'll also benchmark operations such as internally backing up my Android phone to the card.  Then I'll update this review with some accurate numerical data.  But in the mean time on first look, the person who said that the S 3 has problems with anything faster than class 6 may not have been correct - a full backup of the phone to the card was significantly faster than the backup with the old 16GB class 6 card.  Again no benchmarks yet but once I have them I'll include them here.Right now I'm very happy with this card and I'm really impressed - both with the card and with the unbelievably quick service from Amazon (and I'm in Atlanta where shipments like this one often take the full 3 days to arrive).",5
"Yup, this is the chip you need if you never want to worry about running out. I use it with my GoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition on 1080 sw  and it goes for hours, longer than 2 or 3 batteries.",5
"Every SanDisk card I've ever bought has never disappointed me and this one wasn't the exception. I use one with my Galaxy Tab 3 and so far it has performed superbly and I have zero complaints.I realize there are quite a few bad reviews for this card but I have never ran into a bad SanDisk card and I hope I won't in the future. I feel bad for the ppl who get the ONE bad card in a batch of thousands, but yeah, it happens.",5
Works perfectly in my GoPRo HERO3. Can't ask for more for the price. No issues with the card to date.,5
Still amazes me how small this hardware is with such a large amount of storage.  SanDisk is a leader in solid state memory.  I am happy with the reliability and speed of this product and would recommend it to anyone.p.s. The only issue I have with SanDisk is the normally high price; however I got this on sale so I am happy with what I paid.,5
"I am a music junkie and I use my phone as much as a mp3 player and video recorder, then as an actual phone, that I chew up memory quick. Thanks, to Sandisk and my Q10 I can keep expanding my storage.",5
MicroSDXC is the wave of future storage for any manufacturer that has any sense. These little cars can increase the storage capacity of the most basic of devices for far less than buying more expensive models that don't allow external storage. Easy to use and with an industry standard that expands up to 2TB in capacity.,5
"Pros:small,compact32 gbHCcons:none so farThis unit does what any micro sd card should do and does it quickly.  I bought this for my son's android tablet for memory extension and he can run apps directly from the sd card with no problems.",5
"Not much to say about this.  Works well with a Samsung Galaxy S2.  Haven't tested the read/write speeds, but it seems about right for a Class 10 card.",5
"The SanDisk Ultra is a very high quality micro sd card. I have bought several and have never had an issue with any of them, which I can't say about less expensive cards. If you need a card for your smart phone or tablet, this is it, just make sure not to get a bigger capacity card than your device can use.",5
Just popped it in and moved some apps to the card and works great.  Video is handled quickly and all apps start fast.,5
"I recently switched over from an iPhone to a S4 and I'm trying to get used to the lack of on board memory.  This card works well for me because most of my memory is used on pictures.  I'm still working my way around the actual phone and memory, but this serves me well.",5
bought one for my GS3 phone and when I bought my wife the same got her one too.  They seem to work seamlessly.Perhaps over kill for us but cheaper per gig than smaller gig chips...,5
I purchased this card for a new Nokia Lumia 520 smart phone I recently purchased to extend the internal memory of the phone.The card works very well.I'd recommend this card for anyone who wants to extend their internal memory for any devise requiring a microSD.,5
Excellent. Got 2 of these but still testing to see if speed is its greatest deal. Anyway Cheap at the time.,5
"I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Note II. For the money, it's a fantastic value. I haven't noticed any transfer speed issues, and it's been rock-solid reliable for the 3 months I've owned it. I have about 32GB of music stored on it, and every app that can use SD card storage is set to do so, including all my system backups. The ultimate &#34;install and forget&#34; add-on for your phone!",5
This works perfect in my Dell Venue Pro 8. All I had to do was to reformat the card before using it.,5
Works flawlessly in my Note 10.1 2014 edition. You get a bout 62.5gb usable storage.The only thing I have noticed- and to be fair it is most likely the tablet or the app is a stutter when watching HD movies either downloaded fro Google Play or Samsung Hub [I had to use the free gift cards that came with the tablet for something].I have not noticed any real lag or stutter when using the camera app.$34.95 seems to be a fair price- these were about $100.00 earlier this year.,5
"Works. There's nothing else to say so yes it works, and yes it works. It also works, so it is pretty good.",5
Install on Samsung phone and it works great.  Recommend if you need more memory on the phone and install with no problems,5
Excellent item for the price. Class 10 is the way to go if you're uploading or copying files to your computer. I have a 32gb as well and they both work well. No issues.,5
"What more can I say? The 64GB micro SD works for the Samsung Galaxy Note II! I simply popped in the card and there it was with no formatting. ""59GB of space"" couldn't be more happier.",5
"I always use SanDisk so they were my first (and only) option when I got my GoPro.  They are fast and they are good.Can't say too much, SanDisk makes the best cards, period.",5
"I couldn't find this cheaper anywhere else, for the price you simply can't get anything better. Write VERY fast, and has plenty of storage. Using this in my BlackBerry Q-10.Very recommended!",5
I used this to take pictures. It works good. I think it works just as good as any other memory card I have ever used.,5
Bought this and have tested in my Canon SX260. Videos record quick and replay without any loss.Placed in my Samsung Galaxy Tab and works great!Nothing bad to report about this SDHC module.,5
only works with cameras having a remote screw. Works well with Fuji X2. Red even makes it just fine but would like black.,5
get this for my hct phone it works great . not slow like some others i have had . but i didnt know about classes  for memery cards with the othere ones . good card . done not freeze or loose anything,5
Great price for a great card. This is a genuine fast SanDisk brand card. It has worked flawlessly in my Sony DSC-TX200V. Pictures transfer to my computer very fast with a USB 3.0 card reader.,5
Bought This For My Samsung Galaxy S3Load It Up With Music And It Works FlawlesslyI'm Very Satisfied With This Card,5
See above.  Nice to have the extra room in my Blackberry Z30.  LOTS of content goes with me.  Packaging was adequate but not over-the-top.,5
This is the reason why I love non-apple products. You can increase memory with microsd's and its so much cheaper. These class 10 Sandisks' are amazing. I've bought several from 64gb to 16gb and every single one has lasted. I've had the 64gb for months now and I have no issues. The 16gb I've had for a year and its great. I would highly recommend this product.,5
Look no further. Perfect for my galaxy devices. I purchased a few of these and switch them between devices for quick data transfer. Highly recommended.,5
"Is, what it says it is! Great chip, fast, reliable. 6 months so far, not a single problem, and lots of handling too!",5
"Amazon ran a good deal on this 64GB microSDXC, so I jumped on the bandwagon.  When it arrived I snapped a few photographs to test it out and it worked well...until I tried to retrieve the files.  I don't know how, but it became corrupt and no longer would reformat or function in any of my devices.  I exchanged it for a replacement through Amazon and the new one works beyond my initial observations.  Browsing seems much faster than previous SDHC class 10 cards.  Thank you Amazon for your immediate exchange.  highly recommended for today's on the go data storage.  *(original review was 2 stars, but after Amazon's immediate replacement and great customer service I re-rated to 5 stars.)",5
Pros:Maximum external storage for my SGS3.Plenty of space on my phone now to store music and pictures.Fast data transfer.Cons:none.Other:Shipped super fast (think i actually got it next day) packaged well.,5
"This memory card works on my Motorola Droid RAZR M! Even though my phone's &#34;information guide&#34; says it is only compatible with a 32GB memory card.  Once formatted, it works great.  So worth not spending the extra money just to get a phone with a ton of built in internal memory.",5
This is a very capable microSDHC at a very fair price. I popped it in cell phone (Samsung Galaxy S4) and it got mounted without any hassle. I didn't need any type of formatting. Read and write speed is quite fast while using while transferring data to my PC. Shipping was fast and tracking it was easy. This a product I highly recommend.,5
I actually bought two of these items on separate orders and still using it daily with no issues. Beats the competition with quality.,5
So far this item is great. Purchased one for myself and then one for my niece for her phone for XMAS. Another plus the shipping was great.,5
This was the necessary addition to the GoPro mini HD camera.  Very pleased with the service and what was advertised.  Will be a repeat customer for sure as I look forward to adding to my video & photography collection of accessories.,5
This super-speed card works great in my phone. I haven't had any problems with it since I bought the thing! I'm certainly able to record HD video right onto the card no problem. I recommend this for those who need quick data delivery to and from there external card. I recommend it!,5
You buy a several-hundred-dollars-worth product and then you add up a cheap SD card? What a shame! Go for a Class 10 SanDisk card!! They are very fast and reliable. I use it with my Lumix camera and my brother's just bought it for his Galaxy S4 mini...,5
This card works perfectly in my Black Box Original Quality G1W dash camera.,5
It's hard to believe how affordable digital has become. 32 GB in a device one quarter the sie of postage stamp would have been science fiction less than a generation ago.I picked this up for portable music when I didn't want to schlep (or risk) a phone or iPod. Works great with all SD card readers.Select with confidence.,5
Works great as advertised.  No problem with formatting or anything.  Appears to be class 10 as advertised.  Thanks a bunch!,5
"This will work on an I717 note, just need to know how to get it to work,they say that the note can only go up to 32 gigs but that is not accurateI got this one to work on the note 1just format this with your computer with fat32 32kband presto you now have a lot of space for whatever you wishjust download the free version of easy US partition master and format the card using the settingsFAT32 with 32kbit worked for me",5
Picked up a couple of these to put in the Nabi2 Android tablets.  They work just fine expanding the memory to store movies.  Haven't had any hiccups at all.,5
"Works great, low cost, fast, and the bright red makes it easier to find when it gets dropped or misplaced. SanDisk is usually my go to brand for removable media.",5
"Easy to use, no thought necessary and plenty of storage for movies to use on my Microsoft Surface Pro 2",5
This is pretty cheap I wish the 64GB one had been on sale but this one was priced at about 11 dollars so I can't argue. I have this in my Nokia Lumia 1520 and there is no lag I love this card should have purchased more.,5
Nice to be able to stuff 20GB of music and movie files on my phone. And still have room to take lots of photos and video.,5
I know after I buy SanDisk I can be confident that I have a fast and reliable product. Has worked great in my netbook for a few minutes now,5
Shipped fast and worked really well!  I use this just in case I have to take a lot of photos! Loads fast!,5
"I got several of these for my tablet.. So far I am very happy.. Actually I have one in my phone, one in my tablet, and one as a backup for traveling.. So far they have been great for me...",5
It's amazing to have a 128gb micro sd. Works with my Samsung Note2. I am using it on my YOGA 2 Pro with modified nifty minidrive,5
"I saw the difference between this and another of 4gb that came with my digital camera, it's really faster than the other.Now I'm using it in my smartphone without any problems so far.",5
I bought the 32 gb and 16 gb versions to backup photes to my Galaxy Tab 2 while travelling. It works very well an dallows me to view/edit pictures while on the road. It is my primary photo backup system while on the road. The micro SD card is much more secure and less likely to be damaged than a hard drive while travelling.,5
"I mean we all know SadDisk, leaders in micro memory card manufacturing.  Usually $50 got it for $35! Unbeatable. Yes!",5
I have used my memory cards for shooting video with GoPro cameras and pictures with my Canon Digital SLR.  I have never had an issue and continue to use these memory cards in all of my cameras.,5
It works and will give me much more room for music on my samsung galaxy s4!! I will also be able to use this on future phones which is another plus!,5
"I purchased this MicroSD card to record extended 1080p videos and it has worked flawlessly. Camera did not immediately recognize the card, but going into the settings and selecting format solved the problem.",5
I never faced any issues ...so far..so good. It works well with my tablet. It is super fast and reliable.,5
I bought 2 of these one for my phone and the opther for my tablet. you cannever have enough memory,5
This product is great my phone doesnt lock up anymore. I was wondering what a class 10 was and i found out that it means it runs faster than the normal black micro sd card (most are a class 1 or 2) that your smart phone comes with..this card makes a difference in how fast i can get on the internet to...,5
I use this in my surface RT to store movies etc for the kids and be sure that it wont be tampered with,5
"I bought this for my Samsung Note 3 so I could store my entire music library on my phone. All I had to do was pop the cover, and put it in the microSD slot, and it worked perfectly! My phone now has 96GB of storage. Take that iPhone!",5
"Simply Put: It is a 32 GB MicroSDHC card that came in the mail when it said it would, it was empty when I got it, it works as expected (it holds files, images, etc.), and it has the adapter included. Voila.",5
"Purchased this to drop into my Galaxy Note II. Exactly what I wanted.Loaded up the entirety of the card in about 18 minutes, which is not super fast, but very good considering the card was in the phone instead of in the computer using the include adapter.I purchased this product with the worry-free packaging and was for the first time not frustrated with SanDisk.The Super Saver Shipping really sold the deal to me.The price now is on par with most retailers, but I got two Duds from BestBuy and was good to go with the first one from Amazon, doesn't really say much about the product, but gives you a bit of peace of mind when purchasing from this vendor.",5
"Super fast and lots of storage! I can fit months worth of Music, App's and eBook's on it with room to go!",5
This memory combined with the elago mobile nano II USB 2.0 works like a charm. Gives a lot of storage space with great flexibility.,5
"Love it, now i have 118GB in my zte supreme, works really well in my phone, it restarted my phone a few times when i first put it in but no problems after that, no idea why it did that, but now i can fit my entire music collection on my android which has reached 94GB of all rock and metal!!!!!!!!!!!! now i can get rid of that damn ugly ass ipod classic!!!",5
"Worked perfectly right out of the box, and seems to be a lot faster than the old class 10 that were manufactured by SanDisk, or others for that matter.",5
Got this to replace my old class 4 micro sd card in my new phone. Plenty of space and very fast.,5
"I have no issues with this card, and my phone now boots much faster than before with my old 8gb class 4 card.",5
"it's an inexpensive way to expand the 16GB tablet we bought for my wife's sister, who wants big storage.  was pretty easy for the tablet to detect it.",5
"Bought it when the price was low. Excellent value. Good transfer speeds and worked on my phone, camera and other devices as well.",5
"What can I say, So far it came in and works. Can't complain till it fails, so only time will tell...",5
A sweet spot for MicroSDHC's.  Added a nice bump in memory for my Nokia Lumia 822.  Arrived on time and is being used as I write this comment.,5
Bought this to use in a video camera. It's super fast and holds a ton of data. Buy this one!,5
i got this sd card for my trip to hawaii so i could gopro everything. gets about 4 hours of video at 1080hd. works great. no complaints. highly recommended.,5
"got the easy to open package the card worked first time, the Samsung pad recognized it, these cards are a bit expensive though.",5
"This actually came with the SD adapter making it a great buy. Lots of memory, MicroSD, SD and cheap. Can't go wrong.",5
"I use this in my Galaxy S3 so that I can carry all my MP3s that are on my iPOD classic (45GB).The only complaint I have is not with this unit, but with smartphones in general.  They are still to sensitive to be used as a true mp3 player replacement.  If you are not too careful, you may crack the screen on your phone if you try to use it as an all-purpose media player.My ipod classic is five years old and it has yet to have its screen crack on me.  It definitely hold up better at the gym than my phone.  Anyway, this SDXC card is great.",5
Pay attention to your application and what class your card is!  Class 4 or unclassed may be cheaper but it may not give you the performance you want. Don't be pennywise and poundfoolish... this was purchased to go into one of the newer MK808 version tv streamer dongles and those take class 10. For the price this was a good value.I have been using SanDisk xD and sD regular and micro for 8 years now and always found them to be a consistent and high grade storage card. I can recommend this brand.,5
I purchased this memory card to expand the storage on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. After installation my Note 2 recognized the card and I've been using it to store images and music without any issues.,5
Purchased for my cell phone. No problems or complaints. This is my second purchase and so far so good. I have several SanDisk products and have yet to complain.,5
Very pleased with the speed and performance of this memory card.  Use it in both my camera and smart phone.,5
I bought this for my MS Surface tablet and this tripled my storage space.  I copy all my media to this and have endless hours of entertainment when I'm on a plane ride or in hotels.,5
"The memory card was exactly what I was looking for. It came on time, in fact it came early. Now I have upgraded the memory for my tablet and can download movies to take with me any time I need to.",5
I have this in a DROID X on Page Plus.  It works perfectly.  transfer speeds were good.  I have no complaints here.,5
Fits my camera perfectly and gets me about 2 hours of video at highest resolution! I love how easy it is to use and the capacity is perfect for my needs.,5
This sd card is great for my note 3. worked perfectly for almost half a year. I would recommend it to everyone.,5
"I bought this card as high speed external memory for my Asus ME302C tablet to play movies, music, etc. The card meets all of my expectations, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it had absolutely no crapware preloaded. No compatibility issues whatsoever.",5
"I bought this to replace the 32GB microSD I had in my phone that up and died on me.  This one is still kicking, so I guess that's a good thing.  It's been about 6 months and all is good.",5
I was impress with the value and quality. I used SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 with my ASUS 300TF it works great!,5
How can you review a SanDisk card?  It works.  It stores pictures and other items on my phone.  Zero problems with it.,5
My wife's 4 GB microSD card failed on her phone.  So in order to prevent any issues I got one for her phone and one for my phone.  We were able to transfer our photos and music over on to these cards with plenty of room to spare.,5
This is a great buy. High quality and tons of space for any meaty music collection or couple it with videos and pics aas well. Can store roughly 60 movies on this little microSD card. Tons of music. Highly recommend this.,5
This is the best Class 10 MicroSD card I own. I have compared it to my other cards and it out performs all other cards I have. It came with a SD to microSD card converter which is a nice plus. This card come pre-formatted to work with Android devices and Windows devices. Can't get much easier than that.Great card + fast shipping = no complaints,5
So far so good. No problems using this with a Nook HD even though it's Class 10. This includes playing downloaded videos.,5
"I have used many memory devices from SanDisk, as well as a couple of Sansa MP3 players. This card lives up to my expectations. It works well in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. I haven't bothered with the adapter, but I have no doubt it does its job. It is nice to have it just in case I need to read the card outside the phone.",5
"It is reliable sd card. I always used this brand for all of my camera, my smartphone and tablet.Fyi",5
"I used this upgraded card in my Razr Maxx HD and have been nothing but pleased with it. I haven't even come close to filling the entire card. I got it mostly because I keep my entire music library on my phone, about 5 gigs of music. It's a class 10 card so you won't see any lag in pulling up files. Great card for the price.",5
"This worked great in my Samsung Galaxy S4 - plenty of storage for photos, video, and I'm not sure what else to use it for yet.",5
I used this for a Motorola Droid X for music files. loading the files seem to be a little herky jerky but once on there they played fine. Not sure the problem is with the memory card  or the phone. I am using The Amazon app or the Motorola app that came with the phone.,5
And does what is says it will. What else can really be said about memory cards?? They either work or not.,5
"My previous card was a Sandisk 32gb class 4 card. This card's speed is about 3x faster! Now I can put more music and movies to my hearts content! The only thing about this that I can say is a ""negative"" is that in order for my HTC Sensation 4g to recognize it, I had to reformat the card, even though the packaging says it's Android compatible. It even has the mighty green Andy the Android on it! LOL But after formatting the card in windows 7, I was able to use it in my phone. I didn't use the fat32 utilities so I cannot remark about those formatting procedures.Oh and I forgot to add the first card that was sent didn't work at all. The card didn't try to format. Amazon sent me one overnight without charge! Well I had to return the bad one of course, but the process couldn't be easier. The card was actually backordered a few weeks because of the deal of the day Amazon had on the card, which I purchased under as well...This card is authentic, came in Sandisk packaging and is indeed a CLASS 10 card.",5
"I have been using it for several months in a helmet cam, several times a week. No problems so far.",5
"Can't comment on reading speeds, but my flac audio files run smoothly on Sansa. Sandisk have never failed, in other cards so I assume this will hold up to that, if not, I'll update.",5
"I've had this card for a couple months now and it is amazing, i use it in my phone so i can put stuff in there rather then use the space on the phone, its extremely responsive and extremely  fast as well, i had a SanDisk class 4 MicroSD card and this flies past that easily, usually when i would try playing music it would take a couple seconds to start, but using this it starts instantaneous , it was as if i had stored the music on the phone itself, i dont know what else you might use this card for, but if you are looking for a MicroSD for your phone, look no further",5
"it just works great as it supposed to be, i would buy one more for my wife gallaxy S4, thanks!",5
"I ordered this before Amazon fixed their price and it cost $199 USD. The product is great however it is over priced at $199. I think their 128gb Thumb drives go for about $79 USB and were on sale at brick and mortar stores for $69 last week.This is a product that should have been released at least 24 months ago and Sandisk is a company that likes to drag its feet and squeeze people with older cards like the 64gb cards.All I can say is where are the 256gb, 512gb, 1TB and 2TB Micro SDXC UHS-I or UHS-II cards? (They all use the ex-fat file system) I have tested my GS3, GS4, Note 3 and Note Pro 12.2 with this card and all of them read it just fine.",5
I have no complaints.  The micro SD is very fast and fits nicely into the adapter as well.  Great buy.,5
"It performs very well & bought at good price. Works great on my S3 with no problems. i used before on my Samsung Epic but the phone had trouble using it , kept getting &#34;sd card suddenly removed&#34;  notification.",5
"A lot of memories. Works fine with my gopro camera. I thought it was a little expensive but when I see the real price on a store, totally change my mind!",5
"This was a great price for this card, and they are not cheap made. Save several $$$ buying form Amazon, the local stores was a lot higher...",5
"I bought this for my new Galaxy Tab and it works flawlessly, nothing to complain about. I always use sandisk products and they have never fail to me. I have one of these (16 GB) on almost every device at home, digital cameras, phones and now in a tablet.",5
"Excellent, one of the best, can't go wrong with this card, class 10 is necessary and shows noticeable but not significant improvements over class 4",5
faster memory i use in note 3 and i dont have problem its faster to transfer information and 64 really gb,5
I use this primarily to store music and photos on my SD card. The camera writes to the card directly and I notice no difference in speed. I haven't had any formatting issues. First thing I did when I popped this into my phone was format it using the built-in option under &#34;Settings.&#34; It has worked flawlessly for over a month.,5
I would recommend this card to everyone.Data Transfer speeds - excellent with this card on my Galaxy S2.  Didn't need to format the card or anything. I am 100% satisfied.,5
"Figured there was not going to be any issues with SanDisk; produce arrived in well packaged - removed it, formatted it on computer, and installed. Working fine!",5
"I like to keep track of the &#34;Daily Deals&#34; and check them almost daily (resulting in me spending more than I should), but this was too good of a deal to pass up.  I will be upgrading my cell phone soon, so I knew I would be needing it soon.  So, at $30 (with an adaptor and in retail packaging) I jumped at it and am glad I did!",5
"Using it in a cell phone, and so far no problemsI would recommend this o anyone who needs more memory",5
Great deal for a great product. Recommended for anyone needing to expand the memory of their portable devices. Comes with SD adapter for use in card readers.,5
Can't beat the price on this one. 64GB and SD card reader. I use this is in my go Pro 3+ works fantastic.,5
"I got this for the Sports-Vue 360HD action camera. It works fine. It came with a converter to standard SDHC size/format. I used that to transfer files from the video camera to my XP pro PC. It does fine. I left the card in its FAT32 format and it works without a hitch. It's very small, so you must exercise care not to set it down or drop it and lose it. I'm happy with this item and would recommend it/purchase it again. In fact, I purchased 2.",5
Bought this over a month ago and it still works great. been using it in my gopro 3+ snowboarding taking some heavy falls and have had zero issues!,5
this card is use in a galaxy S4; read and write speed is very good. the card comes ready to use out of the box,5
"Just the right size for my knitting and crafting patterns, lets me take them anywhere I go and helps when buying yarn and fabric because all the info I need is on my Nook.",5
"So, I was looking for a card to put all of my music on for those occasions when I have my phone but don't have my HD Zune -- which by the way is the BEST music player EVER and it's just a low-down shame they don't make them any more -- and this card holds all my tunes with about 4GB to spare. Excellent speed for music playback, excellent capacity.  Would be nice to get it in 128GB, but the price of those is simply not reasonable.",5
Arrived on time and was exactly as stated.  A good value for the amount of storage.  Will be filling it up with music.,5
"Purchased it for DATA2SD on my Asus Transformer Prime. It did a great job but eventually the tablet started slowing down anyway so I have replaced it with a Samsung Tablet, which I will use the SD card in it but as a regular form of storage.",5
I plugged this into my Galaxy S3 and the memory was read immediately without having to reformat the disc or do any other preparation. It was just plug and play. 32GB was plenty of space to put my music collection and still have space for recording HD video (in addition to the on board hard disc of the phone). The phone even prompted me as to change the default location of photos and videos.,5
The card seems fast and it's a huge amount of storage for the price. It has worked flawlessly for a few months in a range of smartphones and cameras.,5
"Lot's of storage for little money. There is nothing not to like...except I have to keep writing words because there is a minimum required to rate products on Amazon (probably the only thing I don't like about Amazon). I don't like that, but this was a great deal.",5
The SanDisk Ultra 32 Gb microSDHC memory card is a good value for the money.  It doubles the memory of my new Samsung Galaxy S3 and there is no perceptible delay between access to the card and built-in memory.,5
"Amazing how they keep making bigger storage cards and the price goes down. Wow, these are nice for holding lots of stuff",5
It was what i expected.Didn't test his real speed but as price and size and with adaptor from microsd to SD card for me was ok.,5
Works fine in a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - no need to format (although I did) - recognized as soon as it was popped in 59.47GB usable.Arrived really fast and nicely packaged.  I would order again.,5
"Works, had to give a review of this since it does exactly what is it advertised to! Good buy for anyone!",5
Been using it for a month and everything works fine.I have my SD card encrypted and it does take a little bit longer to transfer.It does get warm when I transfer files for more than 2 minutes but I have not had any performance issues with it.Overall 5/5,5
"It's a Micro SD card, it's 128 GB (which is amazing), and that's just about all I can say...  I do wish it was faster, because I've put 20-40GB virtual machine files on it and it took quite a while for them to copy.  I guess I'm used to SSD speeds.  But anyway, it adds a much-needed additional storage to my tablet.",5
"I have always been a sandisk guy.  This cards works both in my note 3 and s4, gives me 119gb after format.  Can't ask for much more, including the fact that sandisk stands by their products and has excellent customer service.  I could never imagine buying  a micro sd , sd , or ssd from anyone else.",5
This micro SD with adapter works fine.  I have no complaints.  If there was one thing I would wish for is a little less packaging --- it was over packaged for something sent mail order.,5
I ordered these to work in my GoPro Hero3 Black and they have worked well. They came with an SD memory card adapter - perfect for my high speed card readers.,5
"THis is GREAT for my tablet, OMG I have SO MUCH STUFF on storage that it would take me forever to read, listen, and watch it all. Very nice. Very nice indeed.",5
"I'm not sure what to expect from a product like this, over the short term, other than it doesn't fail and is a good price. It has worked well in my tablet without incident. I would buy this again.",5
Excellent price for the amount of storage and speed. I just washed this in the washing machine and was preparing to buy another. After checking it for errors it came up with none. Needless to say I don't have to buy another but did feel compelled to write a review. Cheers!,5
I bought this card to extend the storage capability of my tablet. It holds hundreds of my short video files without having to use the tablet's built in memory. Transfer speed from my computer into the card is relatively fast. If someday I may need more storage in the tablet I can always buy another one of these cards.,5
As usual SanDisk is the best manufacturer for usb and micro SD cards. I'm using this one for my GoPro Hero 3 Black edition and it works really good. I also compared the specs with other Micro SD brands and saw that this one is the best among other micro SD cards,5
There really isn't anything bad you can say about a well performing Micro SDHC. It gives me good speeds and works fine in my devices. There may be a bit of confusion given its look but this is an SDHC Micro SD in case anybody was confused or wondering. 32GB is the official max of SDHC devices so be careful if you see 64GB SDs.,5
True to its name! Sandisk is the best! I am only using this for my smartphone so I guess it's overkill! Many said this type of micro SD card is meant for DSLR's. I'm going for quality and something that would last a long time. That's why I went for this. Highly recommended!,5
This card is so small and yet holds this much storage. No problems with speed or reliability. Can definitely recommend.,5
Works in all my sd devices. I bought this one for my smart phone. plug and play! works great. Would definitely recommend this card and the seller to my friends.,5
This is a high quality easy to use product. Ready to insert and go! No problems with capacity or packaging.,5
"awesome little sd card, my phone is 32GB but I still wanted more for music and videos and this totally works great, as soon as I put it on my phone read it and also it is fast.. I am happy with my purchase..",5
"Installed this into my new Galaxy tablet and sure is nice to have the extra memory, allows for additional apps.",5
"I purchased this card for my Motorola Photon Q 4G LTE.  This is a well spect card and is nice and fast.  Installed with no problem.  If you looking for a higher end SD card for your phone or other applications and 32 gigs is what you need, you can't go wrong here.  Highly recommended.",5
I've heard horror stories about other models but this one is good and it really makes life easier and allows for plenty of storage.,5
"I have used this brand for a while, and no complaints...  writing HD video to them quite often no issues.",5
a fast memory card with room to spare at an amazing price. Suitable for Lots of Smart Phone Movies Fastest storage available today IMHO!,5
Bought this for my new Galaxy S4 and it works great. Class 10 is the way to go especially when slower cards are not much cheaper.,5
Works as advertised for my Samsung GN2 Smartphone.  Got one for my dad's Samsung GS3 too.  Sandisk is simply the most reliable hi-cap micro SD flash memory out there.,5
This micro sd card works great in my galaxy s4. It doubled my storage space and is quick to respond. would definitely recommend to anyone who buys a new smart phone.,5
Works just fine in my Galaxy S4.  No problems.  Unbelievable how much storage you can get in such a small space and for such a low price.,5
There are a lot of reports about 64gb cards not working in the Gopro hero 3. The 32Gb works great for me.,5
I tried this both on Android tablets and the MS Surface.Pros:-True Class 10 read and write speeds-Works with Android phones/tablet and the new Surface tabletCons:-None so far.,5
Writes & reads really fast. The card that came with my dash cam would pause about 11 seconds between files. With the Ultra there is only a one second pause. Now I won't be returning the dash cam. Highly recommend!,5
I used it with my Samsung S4 and it works great. I bring a lot of music and movies with me when I travel and it is great that I don't have to bring an entire hard drive or extra memory cards that can be misplaced. Totally worth the money.,5
"I am continually amazed by the fact that this tiny bit of almost nothing can be so powerful.  However, I caution anyone buying these Micro Cards for their GoPro that they are extremely easy to lose, but I highly recommend them.",5
This card is very responsive and never encountered a single issue. Works great in very cold or hot weather! I am using it when skiing and it is often exposed to very cold weather. I have stored so far few hundred hours of video over multiple events and not a glitch. Would buy again for sure.,5
the packaging opens very easy and the micro sd card works flawlessly in my razor maxx hd and asus transformer.,5
"Bought this for my wife's Samsung TL240, which kept locking up with a lesser speed SD card. After throwing this card in there, the camera rarely locks up when taking pictures back-to-back. If you are shooting 10+ MP and taking pictures back-to-back or shooting HD vid, it's a good idea to upgrade to a Class 10 card.",5
Worked like it is suppose to on my Galaxy S3.  With this memory card now I have over 72 GB of storage!,5
"Wanted to expand my storage on my Surface tablet, and the price was right.Works as expected, no issues.  I'm pleased with my purchase.",5
"My first computer had 64k of RAM.I just put this in my GoPro Hero camera. It has 1,000,000 time more memory. It is great and it works great too.I just initialized it in the the GoPro and I'm saving pictures.Fantastic",5
"not much to say other than plug and play, good quality and fits a lot of video ...good good good",5
I've heard bad things about this 64gb Micro SD card crapping out after a few weeks but sk far so good. Transfer speeds are normal but I like to be space. For the price it was a steal!Would recommend.,5
What can i say my old 8GB died and this is working like a champ trust the brand for a long time and expect nothing but the best,5
"great price and great manufacture.  the item met my needs for my new phone, I'll have ample storage now using this device.",5
"I bought 2 of this, one for a Hero3 camera and one for a Galaxy S3 mini, They both work excelent, recommended for video shooting. Very good price!With the adapter you can use it on a SD card reader (SDHC compatible)",5
I bought this memory for my Samsung Tab 2 8.0. So far it works quite well. I wish my Samsung would recognize the 64 GB.,5
"Seriously, these are the best ones to get for the price. If you pay over 28 dollars for these somewhere else, don't. Perfect for any phone or Cameras or there. It's high class and the gb's is plenty for any average user. In fact I'm a heavy use of data and I never use more than 32gb. If I do i know where to get more =]",5
"I bought this memory card for my smartphone (Nokia Lumia 521) when my older 8GB micro SD card died on me (amazon basics brand).I threw on some MP3s on there to listen on my phone on my trip up the California coast since I knew some areas wouldn't have any radio or cell phone reception, and had no problems with it.I haven't done any speed tests on it as I'm not using it for anything that needs extreme speeds. Its has more than enough speed for capturing video and and pictures.Its a great deal for the amount of storage and its price.",5
"I bought a class 10 Samsung and returned it after I found out the speed was actually lower than that class. After buying and using many different brands, I have found that this company makes the fastest, highest quality, memory cards. Other companies advertise their cards as being certain classes but they are not up to par. I think $19.99 is a steal; best buy sells this product for $39.99. (As of 7-11-12)The card I recieved must have been a dud. It is broken and my phones are not able to read it. When I try to use it in the computer it says the card is damaged. I will be returning to Amazon.",5
"Have saved all the tablets photos, free apps and oodles of other stuff.  I don't see any way to ever use all of the memory.",5
The sd card works perfectly. I use a samsung galaxy s3 lte and the sd was recognized without problems. I did not need to format sd. Just plug and play.Ups sent me the shippment in 3 days. I recommend the product and the provider.,5
I use the SanDisk products for long time now. They never failed me! They have an amazing speed writing and reading and also long life durability.,5
"This card is pretty cheap for how tiny (physically) and large (digitally) it is - at least in mid 2014. I got it to extend the storage capacity of my Surface Pro 3, and it has done just that. I can store files on it so that I don't have to take up precious space that can be dedicated towards programs since the Surface Pro 3 has a full Windows 8 on it. It also doubles as a storage device for my GoPro Hero 3 Black, but I have a faster card for it to prevent the freezing issue. The size of this micro SD card just does a great job in storing data like videos, photos, and music. It fits in most devices that are moving to Micro SDXC, such as phones, tablets, and my beloved Surface Pro 3. I highly recommend this card if you just need to extend the storage of your device. Reconsider a faster card if you want to record video straight to it, like with a GoPro.",5
"I used this for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 . Like the others are saying, it had to be formatted in Fat 32. You can put your apps on your SD card with an app called ""Link2SD"". You just have to partition the SD card in order to be able to use it. Whether you get this card or a smaller one, you need one period for the Tab 2 because you can't do much without a wifi connection if you just have the internal memory and you want to download a lot of apps.",5
I'm not going to give you a detailed speed and what not but this SD card is fast compared to the other ones. You wouldn't really notice the difference in speed unless you're copying a huge file. I use this on my Note 2 and I take a butt load of pictures with my phone.,5
I have come to trust the SanDisk brand for file storage and was not disappointed with this card.  It has held up to months of constant file writing and re-writing with use in a dash cam that loop records.  I recommend this card to anyone.,5
"A memory card either works or it doesn't. This was always going to be a one star or five star review - no middle ground.The adapter is a nice bonus too, though I don't think I have anything to use it with.",5
a class 10 micro sd with 32 gd and san disk...its great! no problems so far and is suiting my needs quite nicely!,5
"It's hard for me to evaluate this product in detail, but I can report that it works just in my Samsung Galaxy S5. I turned the phone off (probably much better to insert/remove cards with the phone turned off) and then slid the card into the slot inside the back of the phone. When I turned the phone back on, there was no obvious indication that I had made any changes at all. However, when I started to take photos, the camera reported that it would now be storing pictures on the card instead of the phone's internal flash memory. So everything seems to work well.",5
"Got a great price on this 64gb memory card. It works fine. The speed is OK, nothing blazing (took a few minutes to move 10gb of data), but it serves my purposes. It has been reliable for me over the past few months.",5
"[[ UPDATE - 6/19/2014 ]]So my lovely wife bought me a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 for Father's Day and I've been loving it ever since.  Just as other with Samsung products, the Galaxy Tab 4 has the ability to add a microSD card to expand the memory on the device.  Since it's been over a year, I decided to do some more research to see if SanDisk offered anything new.  As of 6/19/2014, their product lineup for microSD cards from worst to best (performance-wise) are the as follows:SanDiskSanDisk UltraSanDisk Ultra PLUSSanDisk ExtremeSanDisk Extreme PLUSSanDisk Extreme PRONow, the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read/write data to the card.  Yes, the published rating of most all these cards (except the SanDisk regular) are Class 10/UHS-I but that's just a rating... Actual real world performance does get better with each model, but with faster cards come more expensive prices.  Since Amazon doesn't carry the Ultra PLUS model of microSD card, I had to do direct comparisons between the SanDisk Ultra ($34.27), Extreme ($57.95), and Extreme PLUS ($67.95).As mentioned in my earlier review, I purchased the SanDisk Ultra for my Galaxy S4.  My question was, did I want to pay over $20 more for a card that is faster than the one I already owned?  Or I could pay almost double to get SanDisk's 2nd-most fastest microSD card.The Ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage (storing/capturing pictures & HD video and movie playback) on my phone.  So in the end, I ended up just buying another SanDisk Ultra 64GB card.  I use my cell phone *more* than I do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone, it's good enough for my tablet.  I don't own a 4K HD camera or anything like that, so I honestly didn't see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time.I am now a proud owner of 2 SanDisk Ultra cards and have absolutely 0 issues with it in my Samsung devices.[[ ORIGINAL REVIEW - 5/1/2013 ]]I haven't had to buy a microSD card in a long time. The last time I bought one was for my cell phone over 2 years ago. But since my cellular contract was up, I knew I would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone, the Samsung Galaxy S4. Reason for this is because I knew my small 16GB microSD card wasn't going to cut it.Doing research on the Galaxy S4, I wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity (32 GB or greater). This led me to find that the Galaxy S4 supports the microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I card, which is the fastest possible given that class. Searching for that specifically on Amazon gave me results of only 3 vendors (as of April) that makes these microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 cards. They are Sandisk (the majority), Samsung and Lexar. Nobody else makes these that are sold on Amazon.Seeing how SanDisk is a pretty good name out of the 3 (I've used them the most), I decided upon the SanDisk because Lexar was overpriced and the Samsung one was overpriced (as well as not eligible for Amazon Prime).But the scary thing is that when you filter by the SanDisk, you literally get DOZENS of options. All of them have different model numbers, different sizes, etc. Then there's that confusion of what's the difference between SDHC & SDXC?SDHC vs SDXC:SDHC stand for ""Secure Digital High Capacity"" and SDXC stands for ""Secure Digital eXtended Capacity"". Essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that SDHC only supports capcities up to 32GB and is formated with the FAT32 file system. The SDXC cards are formatted with the exFAT file system. If you use an SDXC card in a device, it must support that file system, otherwise it may not be recognizable and/or you have to reformat the card to FAT32.FAT32 vs exFAT:The differences between the two file systems means that FAT32 has a maximum file size of 4GB, limited by that file system. exFAT on the otherhand, supports file sizes up to 2TB (terabytes). The only thing you need to know here really is that it's possible your device doesn't support exFAT. If that's the case, just reformat it to FAT32. REMEMBER FORMATTING ERASES ALL DATA!To clarify the model numbers, I I hopped over to the SanDisk official webpage. What I found there is that they offer two ""highspeed"" options for SanDisk cards. These are SanDisk Extreme Pro and SanDisk Ultra. SanDisk Extreme Pro is a line that supports read speeds up to 95MB/sec, however they are SDHC only. To make things worse, they are currently only available in 16GB & 8GB capacities. Since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage, I ruled these out.The remaining devices listed on Amazon's search were the SanDisk Ultra line. But here, confusion sets in because SanDisk separates these cards to two different devices. Cameras & mobile devices. Is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt? Unfortunately I'm not sure but I do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars. Since I wasn't sure, I opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices (just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue). To find the exact model number, I would go to Sandisk's webpage (sandisk.com) and compare their existing product lineup. From there, you get exact model numbers and you can then search Amazon for these model numbers. That is how I got mine (SDSDQUA-064G).As for speed tests, I haven't run any specific testing, but copying 8 GB worth of data from my PC to the card literally took just a few minutes.One last note is that Amazon attaches additional characters to the end (for example SDSDQUA-064G-AFFP-A vs SDSDQUA-064G-U46A). The difference between the two is that the ""AFFP-A"" means ""Amazon Frustration Free Packaging"". Other than that, these are exactly the same.  If you're wondering what I got (and want to use it in your Galaxy S4), I got the SDSDQUA-064G-u46A and it works like charm.",5
"Not much to say, It is a memory card and does the job well. No problems at all with this card",5
"I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S4 because it had little available memory on board. Unfortunately the phone doesn't allow for the user to move apps to the sd card, but that isn't the card's fault, it's the phone's fault. The card itself works great and seems to transfer very quickly, my full 1080p HD videos have no trouble recording directly to the card.",5
"I have been using it for over a month now, works well with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. Excellent speed, Do recommend it.",5
Fit my needs nicely in my tablet.  No more buffering anything anymore.  And big enough to hold quite a few movies on.,5
No issues it works great in my device. I don't think it would require more words but I'll type them since it's required.,5
"Nice product,has plenty of space and is very quick and easy to use,it is also nice to have thereafter so you can use on many optional devices",5
"I have this regularly plugged into my ASUS Transformer TF300T tablet as extra storage. But with the included adapter I can also plug it into my laptop. So I use it as a sort of &#34;sneaker-net&#34;, allowing me to move 30 GB of data to what ever I am using at the time. It is filled mostly with pictures and movies. The speed of this makes it convenient for transferring large amounts of data. I'll be buying another one of these in the near future.",5
Ordered this to go with the tablet I ordered for my fiance. It works well and she loves her tablet!,5
"I formatted this card as NTFS...loaded it up with a bunch of my kids' favorite movie and TV shows. Transfers seem to be pretty speedy, even while playing HD content.",5
This card allows the camera to work for hours and continued copies.It was one of the best purchases I have ever made. It was worth the money.,5
I purchased and use with my Surface.  It stores quickly and is easy to use.  I really like that SanDisk makes it compatible with regular SDXC and Micro.  Good product.,5
"I'm currently using this product in my Canon Digital Camera, I took over 120 pictures & 20 videos while on vacation in Escondido, Mexico  with more than 85% room still left on the card! Also with me using a micro SD Card, if I wish to send the picture right away I can easily just snap the card into my cell phone to post the pictures to Facebook or email for example?",5
"Allows me to store quite a few movies in my razr.  Sandisk is THE brand for memory, all of my USB memory thumb drives are Sandisk..",5
"It's a little more than SanDisk's slow 16GB microSDHC, but cheaper than some other brands, and it works.Writes are a bit slow when the card fills up, but that's endemic to all SD cards, and it's not as bad as some other cards.",5
"Works as I expected with ScanDisk. Installed and formatted in my Samsung galaxy note 3 with no issues. Once in the phone, the real amount of usable space is only 59GB just for reference.",5
I have used this product with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and my Sony Xperia Z1 and it performs without fail.  This added much need memory for my phone to take pictures and video.  I would recommend to all Android phone owners.,5
"I purchased this item to expand my Samsung Galaxy tab3 7.0 memory and it fit well and is what I wanted, I would recommend this item.",5
great little SD....,5
got it for my samsung galaxy 3 comes with a free app dont need to buy a card for it tho just search sandick on play store,5
"I had purchased this card for my wife's phone.  She is in love with it as this helped her store all her eBooks, songs, few of her all time &#34;To Go To&#34; movies and her office docs etc. on that new card.  The card came, I formated it and installed it.  Rebooted the phone and it works... Phone was able to see new extpned storage and worked right away.  Its an awesome card - fast read and write.  Highly recommanded for anyone looking to expend their degital storage.Chers!",5
The right size for the GoPro black!,5
It works as expected. What else is there to say? Plug it into my tablet in the micro slot. Slide it into the adapter and plug it into my camera.,5
"One the better names in making computer accessories,  this works just fine in my LG Optimus G Pro, now I have 64GB.  I will purchase again",5
"Why would you get anything less?  64GB of instantaneous movies, video, music or pictures.  If you have an Android phone that's capable of accepting micro SD cards go ahead and get you one or two.",5
"I'm running a live Linux system off of this card right now, via a USB port.  Seems to have good read/write speeds and is durable.",5
"A very cheap way of expanding memory on your 'phone. I have bought this because of the 8 mp camera on my 'phone, which means that memory gets used up quickly. This is also a good quality card. I usually find SanDisk products last at least a year before breaking, and even longer if you keep them in the device.",5
I only buy SanDisk cards and this one is good just like I expected.  Great read and write speed and no issues whatsoever.  I also own the 64GB one and its just as good...Also comes with an adapter so you can use it in bigger/older size sd card slots.Buy with confidence!,5
Got this to use with the GoPro Hero 3 motion camera - fits and works just fine.  Big enough to film several flights and not run out of space.,5
Transfer files easily and very fast. Sandisk makes great SD card and they are very reliable. I am very pleased with this product.,5
Card works great in my GoPro Hero 3 White Edition. I did a 48 hour time lapse and had no issues whatsoever with corrupted data or missing files. I've always had good experiences with SanDisk products and recommend them to everyone.,5
SanDisk is well know brand. The MSD Ultra 64 GB class 10 is the good one to buy.It transfers file faster than other brand card. I bought two of them when they are on sell.The price is very reasonable. I like it very much.,5
"I purchased this for my husband, he's had this quite a while now and love it SanDisk is a reputable product.",5
Bought this for my phone so I don't have to constantly transfer pics to my computer. Works great so far!,5
I use this for my phone and it works just as it should and it was totally worth the money! Great place to store pictures and music for phones instead of using the phone memory so it will still run fast.,5
I have recently purchased a Samsug Galaxy tablet. The SanDisk 32 Gb. Memory Card was an excellent addition to the already powerful tablet PC.,5
"Bought this for my Samsung Tab3.  Works great, fast and have not had a problem.  This will also work with the Samsung Galaxy S4.",5
"hello,we have been using sandisk memory cards since the beginning of sd cards.  this latest version was recommended for my samsung galaxy 4s phone.  with the zillion photos, videos and apps, the original 16/13gb of space was becoming full and not saving due to ""lack of space.""  so, the sandisk micro sd card was the answer.  pop the back off easily on the phone, slip the mini sd card into the provided slot, make sure it ""clicks"" in and put the phone cover back on the unit.  it is as simple as that.  now, i have 32 gb of extra space and my new phone stores anything i want to store.  (i constantly make backups to my home computer...very easy)  the connection simply shows the phone data and the sd card data when connected to the home computer.  i transferred my largest photo/video file to the sd card.  now the original 12gb is open for more instant quality photos and videos.  when the original card gets loaded again.  13meg camera takes super quality photos and videos, but also takes up a lot of space.adding a micro sd card is less expensive than ordering a 32gb galaxy4s, but yrmv  great productupdate...  the original ""super large"" file that is on the sd card still shows up on the original gallery screen.  it still has the same functions, but my original 16gb shows more room for the next zillion photos, etc.",5
I have always had good luck with sandisk memory cards. This one is no exception. Fast works great in my Galaxy S4 and never a problem with any I have purchased.,5
"I use SanDisk Ultra SDHC cards for photo and video and have always been satisfied. When it came to needing a MicroSDHC for a GoPro, I purchased this card. It provides the same reliability, consistency and workflow as the larger SDHC cards and with the included adapter, it easily installs in my current SDHC card reader. It also means I can use it as a back up for my SDHC cards, should the need arise, giving an extra 32 GB as a spare card. Good card at a good price.",5
"I packed everything that I wanted to use on my tablet onto this card and only took up about 25gb, but I haven't seen any delays in response times, whatsoever. It's very comforting to know that I have a massive amount of storage space available for downloads, pictures, videos, etc. Thank you to the manufacturer and seller for such an exceptional product and price.",5
I just love this because i just got a new smart phone and now i am ready to do some down loading.,5
I bought the 64GB version of this card to increase the storage capacity of my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I use it to store pictures and video which I shoot with the phone.  I have never had any issues with the card keeping up to the 1080p video that the phone shoots.Speed as tested on my Galaxy S3 w/ SD Card Tester:Write: 9.6 MB/sRead: 24 MB/s,5
exactly what it says and cheap,5
I bought this for my husband and then the 32 GB one went on sale so I bought that one for him. I use this one in my Tablet and I love it! No issues!!,5
I needed a memory upgrade for my phone which is a Galaxy S3. The time I got it was on sale and  it has yet to fail me once. It stores a good amount of media for my device and can hold a number of 1080 movies and full resolution  pictures I have taken. Very handy for those long distance trips.,5
"Currently using this in a Samsung galaxy S4,with zero issues just put it in your phone and you are good to go.  Apps also seem to run faster off this card than internal memory.  Taking photos/videos at full hd definitely goes quicker than my old 32gb SanDisk card.  Definitely recommend this product.",5
"I originally bought this for my digital SLR and it works the way it is supposed to. Since I didn't need capacity for over 7,000 pictures I put this in my Samsung tablet and got a 32 gb for the camera. If you need or just want 64 gb of memory this is the one to buy.",5
"Having a 32gb mirosd is great! I use it in my phone and hardly have to upload my pics and what not. My phone works faster with all the extra space and I never have to worry about needing to delete any songs,pics,or apps.",5
You do need to have  the right equipment to use as very few can access these.  Only newer and equipment that CLEARLY STATE can use these will work so be aware.,5
SanDisk makes no nonsense great memory. Works perfectly on my S4 and couldn't be happier. I recommend this for sure.,5
I installed this item into my Dell Venue 8 Pro and it has worked just fine at housing my programs.  I'm very happy with this device.,5
"Had had this for about 6 months now and it's in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Haven't had any storage issues and it was a breeze to put in the phone.  I went with SanDisk because of their reputation and reliability.  Sure... I could have gone a little cheaper in price, but it wasn't all that expensive to start with, so why not spend a little extra and get something that will last.",5
I have a MacBook Air and was curious if could put a TimeMachine backup on an SD Card.  For the experiment picked the SanDisk because:I've had great luck with their cards in the pastUsing a microSD gives me the most options with changing tech going forwardAmazon had it for $64 while it was $99 at Best Buy.Well guess what it works great!.,5
great price size and speedyou cannot go wrong with this itemi have bought several of them already in different sizes,5
Sandisk is far away the best memory card ever.I used to this brand because it never fails.The future of this kind is eternal.,5
"Perfect.  Took card put old 32gb card and transferred it over to it in the computer.  (while my Samsung galaxy s5 was off).  Then inserted it in my Samsung galaxy s5, powered up and it was like I had never took the 32gb card out.  Read ringtones, programs stored on external sd card, everything - no errors, no glitches.  Connected the phone to the computer via usb cable and (usb 3 slot) and in no time my 75gb of music was transferred to my phone and it all read and is working perfectly.  I could not be more pleased when a products works like it is supposed to.",5
"I own a couple of these and I've tested them on several devices.  I use these cards mainly for my mobile devices.  The 64 gb has performed well on my galaxy note 2 and galaxy note 3.  I've tested the transfer rates and they are within the prescribed range.  These are not the fastest class 10 cards, but they are sufficient for storing pictures, movies, and songs. I'm able to play songs and movies off of the card without any delay at all.",5
"I use this memory card in a Lenovo ThinkPad Twist. It uses a PCIe Realtek memory card reader, which I fine tuned by bypassing Lenovo's drivers and use the latest reference ones from Realtek directly.In short, I care about bottlenecks that things like a USB card reader adds.I run apps and thousands of files from this card, streaming atop Bitlocker To Go in Windows 8. Already I've poured multiples of the 32 GB capacity in reads and writes to this fingernail-sized drive, and it has kept going.An unbelievable deal, as I'm normally pretty cheap on these things... but I'm glad I was able to get the best for cheap... for once.",5
Got this for my Galaxy Note. I didn't want pay triple the price in the ATT store so I bought here instead.,5
"I bought a similar one to this a little while back for a digital camera, I think I should've gotten this one instead. I believe it's faster (I think mine was Class 4 for the same price). For the money I feel I have all the memory I'll ever need for my smart phone, same for my HD video camera.",5
"There isn't much more to be said.. First, there is the Sandisk name, Sandisk quality and Sandisk speed. The packaging was done well and shipping was not an issue.  As a professional for both video and photography, I've never had a Sandisk product fail me.  This unit was purchased specifically for my GoPro Hero 3+ Black, but could just as easily work in my Canon 5D mk III (with an adapter) in one of its dual slots.",5
"Formatted in computer, popped in phone and bingo bango Bob's your uncle. Phone recognized right away and I had music transferred in minutes.",5
"With the onboard memory, plus this expansion card, my android tablet has more memory than my iPad.  Can I tell if the fast memory is really fast?  No, not really.  It seems to be compatible with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, no error messages, so I guess life is good.",5
The best there is under this category. make sure you research before you buy this card for your phones. Lots of Android phones still dont make use of the UHS-1 technology for transfer rate. You will still get good transfer rate but not the best.,5
"Works great in my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Hold a lot of data files, photos, and apps.  I may never use the full capacity of this reliable microSDXC Class 10 card.",5
Very good product!!!  Comes with an adaptor to fit regular size card slot.So your good to go for both.( I love it),5
My Galaxy S4 16 GB phone is now at 80 GB.  This will give me more than enough room for my music and then some.,5
I've been using this card for over 2 months and it works perfectly. I installed it in a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it was immediately recognized. No need for formatting or other special handling.,5
"Does everything it says without a hitch.  Works like a charm and reasonably priced, which makes it a good value too.",5
What can I say? It works and was formatted for an android already. Tho' I'm sure it will work w/ anything!,5
"Very fast for taking full HD videos, and for transfering to the PC. Great quality, zero problems at all. A legit product from SanDisk!",5
"Love it, good quality good performance, great brand. Could not find better product for my money. Using it for a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini with zero complications.",5
This item is what it is; I've been using it for a few months now and it records HD videos in my GoPro Hero3 without problems.,5
Works great. My phone is happy. I'm happy because I can put more music and pictures on it.  The price was perfect.,5
I use it in my Samsung Galaxy 3 cell phone and it works great.  Good value and quality. I highly recommend it.,5
Good value for the money.  This is a class ten rated card which has a fast speed and from a good manufacturer.,5
"I bought this for my wife when it was on sale for Black Friday 2013, and has been coming to good use since. She appreciates the fact that she has extra (other than built in storage) for her phone to be able to hog on to more pics, music, and games. Great deal on a great product.",5
"A new camcorder required fast SD (micro) and SanDisk products have always provided first class service, so the extra cost is well worth it.",5
"Bought this as an upgrade from having an 16 GB for my android phone, not that I need all the extra space but it's nice to have handy. This will accommodate more pictures and videos that I take with my phone and among other things without having to worry about running out of space, for now. Packaging was good. Arrived on time, having Amazon Prime, that's something you don't have to worry about.",5
Just what I needed for my digital music collection on my phone.,5
"Glad I purchased this item for use with my Samsung Galaxy s3, Im able to record video in HD or store almost anything you'd wanna have on your cell phone or etc..",5
"I purchased new Samsung Galaxy S4 phones for my wife and me. We wanted to be able to take pictures and family event videos without constantly worrying about not having space on the phones. The cameras on the Galaxy S4 are wonderful, but that means bigger files too. These &#34;SanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card&#34; are fast and we have not even begun to fill them up.",5
"If, like me, you are still happily in the Stone Age with Windows XP, your computer will not be able to use this card unless you install Windows Update KB955704.  This update is available from Microsoft.com.Thanks to dOGG94, who pointed this out in Customer Questions and Answers on August 6, 2013.  I installed this update and am now able to load GoPro's pictures onto my computer. dOGG94's answer to the customer question provides the link to the update.  Amazon did not allow me to post the link here.  I don't know why.  Just go to the Microsoft.com updates site and look for KB955704.  Or go to the indicated question for the link.The product description should have provided this information.",5
"I use this card in Smasung Galaxy S4 active and before that I used it in my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. It has always worked flawlessly and never given me a single problem. I use the card to copy movies to it. Playback is always smooth. I mostly play high definition movie rips. These require a lot of processing power and data transfer from the card. It has always done great. I will continue to buy this card. I have one in my MacBook Air for backups. Again, no problems.- Damon",5
I bought this to use with a portable radio that accepts the micro memory card.  The 581 pieces of music I put on it took up less than 4 Gig so I have used it with the adapter in a camera as well.  It  does the job,5
Got this for the Dell Venue 8 Pro and it works perfectly. No complaints. Here are more words to complete my review.,5
"I purchased this to increase the memory of my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.  Just placed it into the slot, was instantly recognized and thus saving my internal memory and increasing the memory of my device. Price was the best, I went to several sites and price closest was $98.  Shipped through my prime and got it in 2 days.  I have seen no issues with this card and am very happy with the purchase.",5
Go two during a &#34;Deal of the Day&#34;. Could not test USB3.0 performance since I dont have a USB3 port.,5
"My first card ordered was bad - my tablet and my computer wouldn't write to it, wouldn't read it. Amazon replaced it immediately and my new card is perfect. Reads and writes very fast, much faster than the HC in my phone. I'm glad I got the HC 1 for my tablet.",5
Very good card and still working now in my car DVR i love it and hoping it working for a long time for me.,5
"I didn't run any metric software on this chip as some others have done, but I can tell you it's a pretty spicey little guy.  Everything I store on it via my ASUS TF300T is accessible faster than any other chip I've tried.  Some videos that ""stuttered"" using other chips are fluid with this one.",5
"Works great in my Galaxy SIII, allows me to both take considerable more music and video with me, while also recording more pictures and video.I haven't done speed benchmarks on the card, but when copying mp3's to it at no point did I think &#34;this is a slow piece of crap.&#34;, as I have with other SD cards previously.  The included adapter made it work directly in my laptop as well.I do recommend anyone with a memory card this large does regular backups to their PC or other media - as nice as it is to be able to take 64gb of pictures, it would make it even worse if you lost your phone and they were the only copy.",5
"I originally bought a Samsung equivalent and then my phone was stolen, so I made the switch.  I have done some research and realized the class 10 and the SDXC are very important as it is the quickest rate of transfer.  However when you read Samsung's description and this one, Samsung claims 80 mbps and SanDisk has 30 mbps, after using both they are identical.  The class and the sdxc are the most important, they are almost absolutely identical.  Samsung's equivalent is $65 and this was under $50.  I haven't noticed a bit of difference, besides that maybe this mircosd card is a bit quicker and easier to move files around.  I store a lot on my phone, which is a Samsung Note 3, this works beautifully.",5
"I was a bit apprehensive about getting this SD card as I had heard that it was not compatible with my Galaxy S III.  I did see one review that said it worked just fine on his S III, so I took the gamble.  I got the SD, immediately reformatted it, which was recommended by a Galaxy representative (I do this all of the time anyway to get any &#34;bloatware&#34; off of the card!), plugged it into my phone, and it worked just fine!  I would definately recommend this SD card!!",5
"Catch them on sale here on Amazon! High speed, qualitty vendor (SanDisk), high capacity micro sd card. Highly recommended to anyone. Using in my Microsoft Surface and Windows Phone 8.",5
I put this in my Nokia Lumia 521 and so far it works really well. I put my entire iTunes library on my phone and it all wrote on the card I believe in under an hour (I didn't keep track).My only regret is I probably should have purchased the 64GB card.,5
This memory works in Samsung Smartphones .It is a fast memorySandisk is the most reliable memories in the market,5
what can go wrong? right? it works and fits what else is there - great price and i love the adapter,5
Upgraded from the 32GB and very satisfied. Works great with my phone and large library of music. Def would reccomend.,5
"Still working with no problems so far, so it seems to be reliable. Not sure what else to say, but they want more words.",5
"Haven't got much to say about this. It's SanDisk, so you know what you're getting. Fast and reliable. Only complaint though is that Amazon wouldn't let me buy more than one in the same order. Other than that, it's just great.",5
No problems at all using this in my Samsung Galaxy S III. Fit right in and started working. I would suggest this to anyone,5
"I bought this for my wife's new SmartPhone, so that she should never run out of space for photographs, or at least it will take her a very long time ;-)  We'll see how long filling it takes once she gets going ;-)",5
Got this for a Galaxy S4 and it worked flawlessly.  Typical SDHC installation with no issues that increased S4 storage capacity.,5
"Popped this into my Nvidia shield for extra storage. It was recognized instantly and was easy to transfer files over.I haven't had it for too long to comment about failures in some of the reviews, but will update accordingly. So far recommended!",5
"Reading through the reviews I expected to have to jump through a hoop, or do something crazy special to make this work. The instructions say only up to 32gb is supported in my device.The card arrived. I chose the hassle free packaging... BEST CHOICE EVER! Inserted into the phone, booted up and chose format just in case on the card. The card formatted and I was presented with around 59gb free. Easiest ever. Very happy being able to start moving my music from the ever so aging iTunes to the card. The read and write speeds are more than acceptable, much faster than any of the other microsd cards that I have. I'm a very technical user, but would have felt very comfortable with talking my mother through such an easy procedure. I am going to assume it would work the same for the galaxy siii (S3).Not much more you can say about a boat ton of storage in a small container. 5 star!",5
"Works as expected, no problems, second time I purchased this item, happy with purchase. Cheapest price I found for Sandisk.",5
good,5
Got this for my phone and it is really great. It holds everything that I want to put on it.,5
"First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail. If all those are a yes for me then I will give it 5 stars. I am not just rating it 5 stars cause its the best product of its class, that is for each person to decide. I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.I have has a SanDisk SD card for 2 years with my phone and it has lasted through the tough times and high heat. I bought this to add movies to my daugther's Galaxy Note 2 10.1 tablet, No changes are needed to format it just plug and play. Buy this product with any of the new Samsung tablets or Note 2 and it will just work :)",5
"it is very good, thanks SanDisk,you must have it with gopro cam to get the benefit of cam, yap.",5
It was good until I lost it in the house.  I think they should put a big ass light on it so I won't loose it.,5
Installed in my Blackberry Q10 SQN100-1 and formatted. Works just fine. Plenty of storage space for pictures and videos of my son at the park.,5
An SD card is an SD card. Unless its broken and I have had no problems. Keep up the good work.,5
No complains.  I have been using this card for a few weeks and have had no problems.  I am very pleased with it.,5
"I was out of space on my Droid RAZR 16GB and still had an empty microSD slot, so I figured I'd pick this up seeing as how it is a reputable brand in flash memory. I am glad I went with the Sandisk Ultra, because there is seemingly no difference in speed between this drive and the built-in internal memory of my phone. I record a lot of videos with my phone and I've been recording straight to this card in HD with no problems at all.Installation was a breeze. I took the memory card out of the package and inserted into my phone. Then my phone brought up a menu asking if I wanted to move my music, videos, and photos to the memory card. I selected all three categories, and in minutes it had moved all of my media onto the memory card. I didn't even have to do anything else. I had read some other reviews that said they had to reformat the card or mess around with moving files by hand, but I didn't have to do any of that.I haven't tried using the included SD adapter yet, but I imagine it will work as well as any other adapter. The adapter and memory card were both shipped in a little clear plastic case, which makes it easier to carry the adapter around with you. So you have it with you when you need it.The price on this card when I bought it was a few dollars more than the generic brands. I decided to spend a few extra dollars on it since I would be really upset if I lost all my photos and videos due to a corrupt memory card. I am very satisfied with the product and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of their phone or anything else this would fit in.",5
"Popped in my Galaxy S5. Works.Disk came with an enclosure to be used when inserting into PCs, laptops, and other devices.Shipping was fast.",5
"I had wanted to get the most I can out of my hero3, At the time I got my hero3 this was the recommended card, but there were many problems with people having issues with it. Since then Gopro has endorsed other card and from what I understand changed the firmware to prevent problems.... The problems is only with the 64gb version, from what I read the 32gb and lower versions are ok...",5
Works great in my Motorola Atrix 4G.  Consistently reliable - never any problems.  Will definitely purchase SanDisk again in the future.  Keep up the great work!,5
"Lots of capacity, no problems with loading it up, and no issues with corruption.  Transfers and access are fast and you really can't beat the price for a name-brand card.Not much more to say... it's a memory card that works :-)",5
"The last few days I have been diligently shopping for a MicroSDXC card to utilize in my new smart phone. I have a long term positive experience using SanDisk cards. I quickly became confused about the differences between the so called ""Mobile"" Ultra cards and the Ultra cards. The performance specs to my ""intermediate tech experience"" eyes were virtually the same. The prices were also similar, with the ""Mobile""version slightly higher. To finally resolve my confusion I contacted SanDisk technical support. To my surprise, the ""Mobile"" version is the older, no longer manufactured version. The Ultra is the current model. So I immediately bought the current Ultra version, which very fortunately AMAZON had on sale!",5
"did not work when first inserted into my samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1 with ICS. put it in my samsung galaxy sII phone which recognized it and formatted it. then placed it back in my tablet and 57GB are available. should note that my phone was not running ICS at the time, that was yesterday and now it has ICS on it. So not sure if that matters but it does work and i now have a 64GB micro SD card that works in my tablet and pc and phone. so much for the 32GB limit.Enjoy!",5
"I purchased this for my grandson for his tablet. I actually purchased 2. He loves his games so I wanted to be sure he had plenty of space to save everything he wanted. They must be working, I've heard no complaints.",5
"works like a charm...expand my tablet capacity and now I have lots of space for apps, music and videos without worries",5
I bought it because it was a great price for the capacity and rated speed. I use it for storage in my Nook HD+,5
"I carry a ton of digital content with me on my phone and never want to run out of space.  This is a very fast Micro SD Card and gives me 75 GB of usable space on my Samsung Galaxy Note II.  I can take 20 pictures in about 5 seconds while listening to music.Fast, efficient and tons of storage ... who can ask for more!BillH",5
"Excellent secondary storage device! I have one installed in my mobile phone, and one in my tablet. They have greatly enhanced my multimedia options. My phone has over 4000 songs on it with room for more. My tablet has about 42 full-length good quality movies loaded.",5
"I use this to hold all 22 gigs of my music on my galaxy S3. And I still have room for several seasons of a TV show. Definitely a great product.The only thing I can complain about is there is a one second gap between songs, At least using Google music. I suppose that's the price you pay for this large of storage",5
super fast card and it has lots of space. great for movies and pictures and music and other stuff. Its awesome,5
does very good..... holds a lot of songs......,5
"Back when I purchased my Samsung Galaxy S4, the deciding factor between it and the iPhone was the capability of SD card storage, so when the chance came to grab a 32GB card for 20 dollars, I jumped on it. It performs flawlessly, and comes with a standard sized SD card so you can fit the micro into it and access it from your computer.Folks, if you purchase an Android phone with SD card capabilities, don't go for the 32GB phone and pay up to a hundred dollars more. Just grab a micro SD card for less, and thank me in the morning!",5
Good bye video camera. Just stick this in your Galaxy Phone and take high def video all day! TONS of storage for an amazing price!,5
There were no issues with this card and my Galaxy S4. 29.71 GB usable space (as was expected). Price was right too.,5
"The samsung  S4 is only 16G not enough so I bough this 32G plug to have more storage , so far I have no problem, music, video, copy/delete file do all kind of thing still good.",5
"Use it as my windows file history drive. It is fairly fast, easy to use and durable. I've also used it as a normal SD card with the included adapter.",5
"If you can get this sd card on special or discount, please grab it up!!  I currently have this in my Surface RT and this has become an instant (fast) 64g of storage.  SanDisk makes very reliable products.  I would highly recommend.",5
"I have been waiting for these microSDs to not only reach 64GB capacity, but at an affordable price.  Found it!  The package arrived early, worked as advertised, so I am a happy customer.",5
Currently using it for my Samsung Galaxy S3. It's very fast when transferring files in and out. No complaints so far.,5
"I got my wife a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 for Christmas, and it took awhile for her to start figuring out all the things it can do.  Once she did, that led, of course, to her wanting to watch movies on it.  That was my signal to spring into action, that is, if I wanted to prevent her from running wild, buying ""digital copies"" of every movie we already have in DVD or Blu-Ray.  You can't play DVD or Blu-Ray movies on this device, but you CAN use your computer's DVD or Blu-Ray drive and commonplace third-party software to convert movies in this format into "".mp4"" and/or several other types of video files that CAN be played on this tablet.Since this particular tablet is capable of playing high-definition video (screen resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels), and we want to use ALL of that high-def capability, my conversion files tend to be pretty large (average 5 to 10GB per movie) ... way too big to be stored on the tablet's limited internal memory.  That's where the tablet's microSD slot ... and this SanDisk flash memory ... comes in.  I make HUGE mp4's, store them separately on a 1.5 terabyte drive, and then load as many of them as I can on this chip, which shows up in the tablet as a separate memory source.  Then all you have to do is pull up one of the movie files from the card, and hit play.  You can use the device's standard video player, or get an app with more controls.Watching high-def video on a tablet that's streaming the data from a memory card (rather than the tablet's internal memory) requires a memory card with very high ""read speed,"" and this SanDisk card's ""Class 10"" rating fills that bill.  That's the difference between cheaper microSD that's primarily designed for simple data storage, and microSD that's designed for higher active transfer/read speeds.  The ""Class 10"" designation generally means that the subject card will transfer data at a MINIMUM rate of 10MB per second.  This SanDisk ""Ultra"" card is capable of transferring data at speeds of up to 30MB per second, depending on the speed of the device you're using it in, and other particulars of the way you're using the device.""Frustration free packaging"" means the chip, SD adapter, and plastic case comes in a little, sealed cardboard envelope with a pull tab opener.  This card comes pre-formatted for Android, and my use of it in the Galaxy Tab 3 for watching high-def .mp4 movies has thus far been flawless.Finally, don't let yourself get burned by counterfeiters in trying to save a buck.  While pricing on memory tends to fluctuate, Amazon's current pricing on this card is VERY competitive with any/all vendors out there selling GENUINE SanDisk ""Ultra"" memory.  Buy from Amazon, or other trustworthy vendor, because I just learned the hard way that these memory cards are being counterfeited in huge numbers ... that is, the counterfeiters are placing SanDisk labeling/packaging on inferior, generic microSD, and selling the bogus chips on Ebay and anywhere else they can.  I bought THREE from Amazon after I got burned by a Chinese seller on Ebay.  The counterfeit packaging and labeling was good enough to fool me, until I actually tried one of the chips in the Galaxy Tab 3 ... the write speed (that is, the amount of time it takes to transfer files ONTO the microSD card) was dramatically worse than the speed of a genuine SanDisk ""Ultra"" card, and the read speed was totally inadequate for playing movies on the Galaxy Tab 3.  I may never have figured it out at all if I didn't already have one other, genuine SanDisk ""Ultra"" with which to compare the fakes.If you want the best, most reliable memory for the microSD slot on your shiny, new Android device, look no further ... this is it.",5
"A good size and good price for a small camera or phone that takes micro SD memory; this is fast but not hyped as AIIIIGH-SUPER-SPEEDY because it doesn't need to be; it's good for all the standard usages of your average consumer (photos, ringtones, games, lightweight video, etc).",5
This is just great. but the damned thing is really small. I had one before but I put it down and lost it for good.,5
It arrived in a timely manner and does what it is supposed to do. It's not pretty and cute but it serves its purpose.,5
"A great memory card, at a very good price. I recently upgraded to this memory card for use in my cell phone, and it has plenty of space to hold all of my music, videos, and photos. I can download as many songs as I want, and take as many photos (at the highest quality) as I want, without having to worry about the memory on my phone filling up.I have used SanDisk memory cards many times before, and I have always had very good experiences. It is still too early to tell if this card will live up to that standard, but so far, this memory card has worked very well for me.The Class 10 rating refers to the speed with which it writes to the card, and I have noticed that it is quicker than my previous micro SD card. As an upgrade and expansion to your smartphone's memory, I highly recommend this card!",5
"I trust the San Disk name and have no issues.  For a phone, Class 10 is a must.  Good price for this product.",5
My Headline says it ALL!  How can U go wrong?  & the price was better that what I was looking for.  If U have read any of my past reviews I hope that they have helped of u're on the fence about a pending purchase or have nothing to base a decision on.,5
"Well, this card is pretty cool. I received one that says C10 instead of U1 (like this picture).  For what I use it, U1 won't work, so the one I received is C10.  I needed mine for a iON Air Pro camera, and the advertisements that &#34;supposedly&#34; say class10 on the page description, but it says U1 on the card won't work for the camera.I don't know why they don't call it Ultra 1 instead of falsely advertising it as a C10 when it really is a U1.  I was lucky to receive a C10, so it worked out, but it makes it more confusing for the other laymen.",5
"On time, so much memory!!!!!!  I used my 32GB on a week vacation and didnt even fill it up.  I'll use this one next, but my 32GB is the same brand, class and speed.",5
"Great capacity and never had to reformat it, blue tooth transfers work great from previous phone to this memory card.",5
"I use this on my 32 GB Microsoft Surface RT and it does the job as advertised, so 5 stars.I have used it to extend the storage capacity on the tablet to 64GB for storing documents, pictures etc. There are many articles on the internet that show you how to do that.",5
"Great memory card, I love the fact that this came in frustration free packaging. And even better, it also came with an SD adapter for free! Thanks a bunch amazon and SanDisk.",5
Great micro sd card and for 35$ its extremely cheap. Got 2 of thoses and i`ve never looked back. UHS1 = fast!,5
Very fast reading and writing for my samsung galaxy s4 from verizon. Highly recommended. Sandisk is numero uno for smartphones.,5
"Popped this into my Samsung Galaxy S4 right out of the box. No issues whatsoever. Have saved music, movies, photos, etc, with no issue. The adapter works in my computer and printer.",5
6 months later and no problems. It's a very solid product and I'm very happy with it. Would order again.,5
great fit and works great fit right into my phone without any problem just like one i would have gotten from (their store) but cheaper on here amazon,5
"exactly what I neededTook the old 32 GB card out of my Samsung Galaxy S4 to put in my digital recorder so I bought this new 64 GB card for the phone.As advertised, very fast and stable (I try to transfer as many of my apps to external media on the phone to free memory on the phone) and I have not had one problem as of yet.Highly recommended",5
"There's not much to say about this product, other than it works perfectly as it should.  I originally bought this for a tablet that had an expansion slot, but I returned that for another tablet without one.  So I thought I didn't have a use for this card anymore, but I was wrong.  It turns out that when you put it in it's full size SD card adapter, it even works perfectly in my Nikon D90 DSLR.  Up until now I had been using a standard 8gb card, which was fine, but 64gb is even better!  I don't do burst shooting, so I can't attest to how quickly it can write, but I noticed no difference in speed between this and the standard card that I had been using.",5
Works great with a Dell Venue 8 Pro.,5
"I purchased this after my wife and I bought our Samsung Galaxy S4 to store all the music, pictures and videos.  The S4 camera is capable of capturing 16-megapixels photos so the 16GB microSD that I had will not suffice.  As a matter of fact I've already exhausted the remaining space on the card so this 64GB will allow me to take more photos (of our son).",5
I have purchased and used several SanDisk memory cards and I have never experienced any issues with those cards.  One of my first choices when I am in the market for a memory card,5
Fast and reliable. Have worked with it for around 2 months now and nothing to complain about.Good fit for my Asus TF700,5
More than a year in and still going strong. It boosts the memory of the tablet so I can store movies for trips and the tablet stores big files there automatically to save it's own brain for more important things.,5
Now I have a lot more room on my phone. It can be overkill for some but extra space is only wasted if you never use it.,5
Came too late in the ski season but will be mounting it on my bike helmet this Summer and then again when the ski season starts on my ski helmet.,5
I so wanted this to work but discovered when it was in transit that the Razor Maxx HD only supported a 16 GB micro card.  So I ordered the 16 and am totally happy.  I am tempted to by this 64gb again and give it a whirl.,5
"Performs as expected. I bought for mi Galaxy S3 to increase it storage options, when I need to transfer big files I use a usb adapter since the wifi and mtp conectios speed is far slower than directly connecting the device but that is not the cards problem. Its fast reading and writing inside the S3 and when connected to a current generation computer.Old computers will read and write at slower speeds, but is still compatible hardware wise. The exfat format can be a hassle.No problems yet hardware wise. I would have preferred an open standard as partition format instead of exfat, but that is Microsoft fault not Sandisk.Is easy to reformat with a USB sd/micro-sd adapter.",5
I bought this micro SDHC card for my Nook HD+ device because I was going to install N2A and it worked perfectly.,5
"A micro card that has 64G still just blows my mind. I put this card in my Galaxy Tab and I love it. It gives me plenty of storage for my music, videos, movies, photos, etc. The speed is awesome too. That makes uploading to it that much more enjoyable. I recommend it.",5
