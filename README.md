### Project Description  

Currently, there is a business text data set, with a standardized data splitting and evaluation metric. Our task is to develop a “good-performing” decision support system that classifies text. To achieve this, we will need to:  

1.Build a baseline model (i.e., a model with basic setup and no fine-tuning, e.g., logistic regression)  

2.Compare with a range of different data analytics models (e.g., Gradient boosting tree, decision tree, etc) and different word embeddings models (BERT, GloVE, Word2vec, etc)  

3.Fine-Tune different hyper-parameter for each model above and report the best score  

4.Visualize with a range of different data statistics methods. There are many ways that can describe patterns found in data include chart and figures (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, word cloud, word distribution, etc), as well as statistical metrics like central tendency (mean, mode and median) and dispersion (range, variance, maximum, minimum, quartiles), correlation and standard deviation.  

5.Explore different methods to improve baseline models.  



### About Dataset  

One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the correct calculation of the points given to after-sales products. The solution to this problem is to provide greater customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, product prominence for sellers, and a seamless shopping experience for buyers. Another problem is the correct ordering of the comments given to the products. The prominence of misleading comments will cause both financial losses and customer losses. In solving these 2 basic problems, e-commerce site and sellers will increase their sales, while customers will complete their purchasing journey without any problems.  

This dataset consists of ranking product ratings and reviews on Amazon. 
Product ratings on Amazon are typically divided into five levels, represented by stars, with 5 stars being the highest rating and 1 star being the lowest rating. These levels correspond to the following assessments:
5 Stars: I love it
4 Stars: I like it
3 Stars: It's okay
2 Stars: I don't like it
1 Star: I hate it
